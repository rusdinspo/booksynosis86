As punishment for his spectacular car wreck, the local authorities of the small Tennessee town of Judas Grove give him a choice: serve three months in jail for reckless driving, or spend two weeks teaching the local ministers to drive stock cars, so that they can compete in race whose prize is the $2 million legacy left by that deceased NASCAR fan.</p><p>Sharyn McCrumb&#39;s first co-authored novel, Once Around the Track, was written with NASCAR driver Adam Edwards, and will be published in April 2010 by the Ingalls Publishing Group. Adam, who was the model for the character Tony Lafon in Once Around the Track, has driven in the ARCA/REMAX national racing series, managed and spotted for a NASCAR Nationwide racing team, and worked as a race car driving instructor at the Fast Track School of Racing. When he gave her technical advice during the writing of Once Around the Track, she suggested that they try to write a novel together, loosely based on Adam&#39;s experiences teaching race car driving. Faster Pastor is the result of that collaboration.Collaborating with racing expert, Adam Edwards, she composes the skilled but hapless hero, Camber Barker, a Cary Grant of speedways classic Southern humor with stock car smarts. --Rob Neufeld, Asheville Citizen Times<br><br>Along the twists and turns of the plot, the authors offer lots of fascinating details about stock car racing, making this book a perfect gift for beginning racing fans. The only thing more rare than a good novel is a good novel that can make me laugh out loud. I actually slapped my knee a few times, thats how hilarious Faster Pastor is. Any Hollywood producer worth her stripes should immediately option this heartfelt, action-packed, goofy novel and put it on the big screen ---- Cauley Bennett, Rapid River Monthly</p><h2>An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding: With a Supplement, An Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature</h2><p>An abstract of a treatise of human nature with an introduction by Charles W.

In the eurozone, these sources of instability were multiplied by the tragically defective architecture of the monetary union. It also shows how much of the orthodoxy that shaped monetary and financial policy before the crisis occurred was complacent and wrong. In doing so, it mercilessly reveals the failures of the financial, political and intellectual elites who ran the system.<br><br>The book also examines what has been done to reform the financial and monetary systems since the worst of the crisis passed. &#x201c;Are we now on a sustainable course?&#x201d; Wolf asks. &#x201c;The answer is no.&#x201d; He explains with great clarity why &#x201c;further crises seem certain&#x201d; and why the management of the eurozone in particular &#x201c;guarantees a huge political crisis at some point in the future.&#x201d; Wolf provides far more ambitious and comprehensive plans for reform than any currently being implemented.<br><br>Written with all the intellectual command and trenchant judgment that have made Martin Wolf one of the world&#x2019;s most influential economic commentators, <i>The Shifts and the Shocks</i> matches impressive analysis with no-holds-barred criticism and persuasive prescription for a more stable future. It is a book no one with an interest in global affairs will want to neglect.</p><p><b>Martin Wolf </b>is the associate editor and chief economics commentator at the<i> Financial Times</i>, London. He is the recipient of many awards for financial journalism, for which he was also made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000. His previous books include <i>Fixing Global Finance</i> and <i>Why Globalization Works</i>.<p>The financial and economic crises of the Western world became visible in the summer of 2007 and reached their apogee in the autumn of 2008. The response was an unprecedented government-led rescue operation. That, in turn, triggered an economic turn-around in the course of 2009. But the recovery of the high-income countries was, in general, disappointing: output remained depressed, unemployment stayed elevated, fiscal deficits remained high, and monetary policy seemed, by conventional measures, unprecedentedly loose. This is beginning to look like a Western version of Japan&#x2019;s prolonged post-bubble malaise.<br> &nbsp;<br> One reason for persistent disappointment is that the Western crisis became, from 2010 onwards, also a deep crisis of the Eurozone. Crisis dynamics engulfed Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and even Italy. All these countries were pushed into deep recessions, if not depressions.1 The price of credit remained high for a long time. By early 2013, the sense of crisis had abated. But chronic economic malaise continued, with no certainty of a strong recovery or even of enduring stability.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, emerging economies, in general, thrived. The worst hit among them were the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, many of which had run huge current-account deficits before the crisis. Like the members of the Eurozone in Southern Europe, these were then devastated by a series of &#x2018;sudden stops&#x2019; in capital inflows. Other emerging and developing countries proved far more resilient. This was the result of a big improvement in policy over the previous decades. Particularly important was the move towards stronger external positions, including a massive accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves, particularly by Asian emerging countries, notably including China. This gave them the room to expand domestic demand and so return swiftly to prosperity, despite the crisis. Those emerging and developing countries that could not expand demand themselves were often able to piggyback on the stimuli of others, particularly China. That was particularly true of the commodity exporters. This represents an important&nbsp;&#x2013; and probably enduring&nbsp;&#x2013; shift in the world economy: the old core is becoming more peripheral. But the sustainability of the expansionary policies adopted by emerging economies, and so their ability to thrive while high-income countries continue to be weak, is in doubt. Particularly important is the risk of a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy and the likely associated weakness of commodity prices.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1<br> &nbsp;<br> From Crisis to Austerity<br> &nbsp;<br> The central problem of depression-prevention [has] been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert E. Lucas, 20031<br> &nbsp;<br> When I became Treasury secretary in July 2006, financial crises weren&#x2019;t new to me, nor were the failures of major financial institutions. I had witnessed serious market disturbances and the collapses or near collapses of Continental Illinois Bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Salomon Brothers, among others. With the exception of the savings and loan debacle, these disruptions generally focused on a single organization, such as the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crisis that began in 2007 was far more severe, and the risks to the economy and the American people much greater. Between March and September 2008, eight major US financial institutions failed&nbsp;&#x2013; Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Wachovia&nbsp;&#x2013; six of them in September alone. And the damage was not limited to the US. More than 20 European banks, across 10 countries, were rescued from July 2007 through February 2009. This, the most wrenching financial crisis since the Great Depression, caused a terrible recession in the US and severe harm around the world. Yet it could have been so much worse. Had it not been for unprecedented interventions by the US and other governments, many more financial institutions would have gone under&nbsp;&#x2013; and the economic damage would have been far greater and longer lasting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hank Paulson, On the Brink (2010)2<br> &nbsp;<br> Hank Paulson is a controversial figure. For many Americans, he is the man who bailed out Wall Street too generously. For others, he is the man who failed to bail out Wall Street generously enough. In his thought-provoking book, Capitalism 4.0, the British journalist Anatole Kaletsky blames him for the disaster, writing that &#x2018;the domino-style failure of US financial institutions that autumn [of 2008] was not due to any worsening of economic conditions&nbsp;&#x2013; it was simply a consequence of the US Treasury&#x2019;s unpredictable and reckless handling first of Fannie and Freddie, then of Lehman, and finally of AIG.&#x2019;3<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever we may think of Mr Paulson&#x2019;s culpability, we cannot deny his outline of what actually happened in 2007 and 2008. In this chapter, I will not attempt a detailed account of how the crisis that hit the core high-income countries in those years unfolded. That has been done in other publications.4 My aim here is rather to demonstrate its scale, the extraordinary policy response and the economic aftermath. I will postpone detailed discussion of the economic and financial origins of the crisis to Part II of the book and analysis of the very different impact upon emerging and developing countries to Chapter Four. By focusing on the high-income countries, I want to show that this was no ordinary economic event. To pretend that one can return to the intellectual and policymaking status quo ante is profoundly mistaken.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS<br> &nbsp;<br> The world economy of the 2000s showed four widely noticed and, as we shall see, closely related characteristics: huge balance-of-payments imbalances; a surge in house prices and house building in a number of high-income countries, notably including the US; rapid growth in the scale and profitability of a liberalized financial sector; and soaring private debt in a number of high-income countries, notably the US, but also the UK and Spain. Many observers doubted whether this combination could continue indefinitely. The questions were: when would it end, and would it do so smoothly, bumpily or disastrously?<br> &nbsp;<br> The answers, it turned out, were: in 2007 and 2008, and disastrously. Already in March 2008, I assessed the unfolding crisis as follows:<br> &nbsp;<br> What makes this crisis so significant? It tests the most evolved financial system we have. It emanates from the core of the world&#x2019;s most advanced financial system and from transactions entered into by the most sophisticated financial institutions, which use the cleverest tools of securitisation and rely on the most sophisticated risk management. Even so, the financial system blew up: both the commercial paper and inter-bank markets froze for months; the securitized paper turned out to be radioactive and the ratings proffered by ratings agencies to be fantasy; central banks had to pump in vast quantities of liquidity; and the panic-stricken Federal Reserve was forced to make unprecedented cuts in interest rates.5<br> &nbsp;<br> Far worse was to follow in the course of 2008.<br> &nbsp;<br> This crisis had become visible to many observers on 9 August 2007, when the European Central Bank injected &#x20ac;94.8bn into the markets, partly in response to an announcement from BNP Paribas that it could no longer give investors in three of its investment funds their money back.6 This event made it clear that the crisis would not be restricted to the US: in the globalized financial system, &#x2018;toxic paper&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; marketed debt of doubtful value&nbsp;&#x2013; had been distributed widely across borders. Worse, contrary to what proponents of the new market-based financial system had long and, alas, all too persuasively argued, risk had been distributed not to those best able to bear it, but to those least able to understand it.7 Examples turned out to include IKB, an ill-managed German Landesbank, and no fewer than eight Norwegian municipalities.8 These plucked chickens duly panicked when it became clear what, in their folly, they had been persuaded to buy.<br> &nbsp;<br> On 13 September 2007, Northern Rock, a specialized UK mortgage-lender, which had been offering home loans of up to 125 per cent of the value of property and 60 per cent of whose total lending was financed by short-term borrowing, suffered the first large depositor &#x2018;run&#x2019; on a British bank since the nineteenth century.9 Ultimately, the Labour government nationalized Northern Rock&nbsp;&#x2013; paradoxically, very much contrary to the company&#x2019;s wishes. Reliance on short-term loans from financial markets, rather than deposits, for funding of long-term illiquid assets had, it soon turned out, become widespread. This was also a dangerous source of vulnerability, since explicit and implicit insurance had made deposits relatively less likely to run than market-based finance. That lesson proved of particular importance for the US, because of the scale of market-based lending in the funding of mortgages. As managing director of the huge California-based fund manager PIMCO (the Pacific Investment Management Company), Paul McCulley in 2007 labelled this the &#x2018;Shadow Banking System&#x2019; when he spoke in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the annual economic symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The label stuck.10 Both these lessons&nbsp;&#x2013; the widespread distribution of opaque securitized assets (the bundling of debts into marketable securities) and the reliance of so many intermediaries on funding from wholesale markets&nbsp;&#x2013; turned out to have great relevance as the crisis worsened in 2008.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, on 16 March 2008, the Financial Times reported: &#x2018;JP Morgan Buys Bear Stearns for $2 a Share&#x2019;.11 The Federal Reserve provided backup funding of $30bn for this operation, taking some of the credit risk in the process. Just a year before that calamity the Financial Times had reported: &#x2018;Bear Stearns yesterday became the latest Wall Street bank to report strong earnings and insist that it does not see much lasting impact from the crisis in the subprime mortgage market.&#x2019;12 It would say that, wouldn&#x2019;t it? But the likelihood is that its management, along with almost everybody else, did not imagine the horrors to come. They were probably more fools than knaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> The rescue prompted me to write in the Financial Times of 25 March 2008:<br> &nbsp;<br> Remember Friday March 14 2008: it was the day the dream of global free-market capitalism died. For three decades we have moved towards market-driven financial systems. By its decision to rescue Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve, the institution responsible for monetary policy in the US, chief protagonist of free-market capitalism, declared this era over. It showed in deeds its agreement with the remark by Joseph Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, that &#x2018;I no longer believe in the market&#x2019;s self-healing power&#x2019;. Deregulation has reached its limits.13<br> &nbsp;<br> The US government took the two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which then guaranteed three-quarters of US mortgages, into &#x2018;conservatorship&#x2019; on 7 September. This proved what investors (and critics) had long believed, namely, that the US government stood behind the vast borrowings of these allegedly private companies ($5,400bn in outstanding liabilities at the time of the rescue).14 Yet it then, controversially, allowed (or felt obliged to allow) Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt on 15 September.15 Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America for $50bn, or $29 a share, on the same day&nbsp;&#x2013; a big premium above its share price of $17, but a reduction of 61 per cent on its share price of $75 a year before and 70 per cent from its pre-crisis peak.16 Then, promptly after refusing to rescue Lehman, the US government saved the insurance giant, AIG, taking a 79.9 per cent equity stake and lending it $85bn on 16 September.17 In his book, Mr Paulson argues that the decisions were not inconsistent, because, &#x2018;Unlike with Lehman, the Fed felt it could make a loan to help AIG because we were dealing with a liquidity, not a capital, problem.&#x2019;18 If the Fed really believed that, it was soon proved wrong. A more likely reason is that Mr Paulson believed (wrongly, as it turned out) that the markets would take Lehman&#x2019;s failure in their stride, but was sure the same would not be true for AIG, given its role as a seller of &#x2018;credit default swaps&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; insurance contracts on bonds, including the securitized assets that had become increasingly toxic.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, on 17 September, one of the money-market funds managed by Reserve Management Corporation (a manager of mutual funds) &#x2018;broke the buck&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; that is, could no longer promise to redeem money invested in the fund at par (or dollar for dollar)&nbsp;&#x2013; because of its exposure to loss-making loans to Lehman. That threatened a tsunami of redemptions from the $3.5tn invested in money-market funds, a crucial element in funding McCulley&#x2019;s &#x2018;Shadow Banking System&#x2019;.19<br> &nbsp;<br> PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the UK&#x2019;s bankruptcy administrator for Lehman, seized the failed company&#x2019;s assets in the UK, including the collateral of those who traded with it.20 This came as a shock to many hedge funds and US policymakers. The fact that bankruptcy regimes were different in different countries&nbsp;&#x2013; obvious, one would have thought&nbsp;&#x2013; turned out to be a significant problem in dealing with the aftermath of Lehman&#x2019;s failure. As Mervyn (later Lord) King, governor of the Bank of England, famously quipped: banks were &#x2018;international in life, but national in death&#x2019;.21 Funding for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two surviving broker-dealers, dried up.22 On 21 September these two institutions turned themselves into bank holding companies, a change that gave them access to funds from the Federal Reserve.23 On 25 September the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over Washington Mutual, the sixth largest bank in the US.24 Not long afterwards, on 9 October, Wells Fargo, the country&#x2019;s fifth largest commercial bank, agreed to a takeover of Wachovia, the country&#x2019;s fourth largest.25<br> &nbsp;<br> The mayhem was not restricted to the US. On the weekend before the Lehman bankruptcy, the UK government refused to support the takeover mooted by Barclays. As Alistair Darling, then chancellor of the exchequer, claims in his memoir, &#x2018;we could not stand behind a US bank that was clearly in trouble&#x2019;. Why, indeed, should the UK government provide guarantees that the US government had rejected? Moreover, he adds, &#x2018;I was determined that UK taxpayers would not end up having to bail out a US bank.&#x2019;26 On 17 September, with government encouragement, Lloyds TSB announced a �12.2bn takeover of Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). The government argued that the public interest justified clearing the deal, despite concerns over its adverse impact on competition, in order to &#x2018;ensure the stability of the UK financial system&#x2019;.27 On 29 September the government decided to nationalize Bradford &amp; Bingley, the biggest lender in the UK&#x2019;s &#x2018;buy-to-let&#x2019; market, while its branch network was subsequently sold to Santander.28 Worse, it was becoming obvious that HBOS was too bad a bank for Lloyds to support unaided.

Starting in 1986, this belief has been sorely tested. The floodgates of information were opened, but no miracle followed. No new sense of morality was awakened,&nbsp; no one rushed to redeem the nation. Indeed, once the novelty of free speech wore off, people lost interest in it. While the intelligentsia was watching its most treasured dream disintegrate, it was also losing its social standing, its prestige and, finally, its money. As it had frequently done in the past, the intelligentsia responded by declaring itself dead, obsolete. Once again, it was the end.<br><br>Masha Gessen, one of the most perceptive of a new generation of correspondents in Russia, does not share this opinion. Her fascinating book is the first to examine the ways in which intellectuals are finding an identity in the new Russia. Through a series of extraordinary individual stories, she shows their quest for a new faith, be it religion or the paranormal, a commitment to nationalist ideology, or to feminist principles. She shows, too, their search for a place in the new society, as artist or politician, entrepreneur or neo-dissident. Some of those she describes as already famous (or infamous); others unknown. Her accounts of their careers and preoccupations can be inspiring or harrowing, and sometimes hilarious. Finally, Masha Gessen considers the prospects for future generations of intellectuals, giving a vivid, and disturbing, portrait of Russia&#x2019;s outcast Generation X, and of those younger still, who have largely abandoned any notion of society or hope for a place in it.</p><p>Masha Gessen was born in Russia in 1967, and forced to leave in 1981 by state-enforced anti-Semitism.

Water is the base ingredient of winemaking, and for people who believe in the transformative power of wine, water has become the new petroleum&#x2014;hoarded and stolen, the target of greed and the source of treachery, even among friends. Brunella struggles to protect her father&#x2019;s land from a mysterious force&#x2014;someone who seems to be buying up all the water and driving away the people who work the land. When a wildfire roars out of control and kills a squadron of firefighters, the question of the lack of water becomes ever more urgent for Brunella.<br><br>Her search to uncover the real cause of the tragedy will determine where, how, and with whom she will spend her life. It propels this powerful debut novel to a startling conclusion.</p><p>While <i>The Winemaker's Daughter</i> may be his first foray into fiction, Seattle author Timothy Egan is certainly no stranger to critical acclaim. As his debut novel deftly illustrates, this Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist certainly shows great talent for capturing the essence of a scene. His descriptive prose is infused with a certain lushness--just like a misty Seattle day. Where Egan stumbles, though, is in trying to bring together several plot lines and characters. While they share a thinly knit connection, none of them ever rises up to truly engage the reader.<p> The novel follows the story of Brunella Cartolano, an Italian winemaker's daughter who embarks on a battle to save her aging father's Pacific Northwest vineyards after a treacherous fire takes the life of her brother, Niccolo. At the same time, Brunella is struggling to preserve a historic Seattle waterfront from being destroyed and redeveloped by a Bill Gates-like millionaire. Brunella is also pursuing a romantic relationship with her brother's friend Teddy Flax, and with the Nez Perce Forest Service man who is investigating the fire that took her brother's life. Confused? Herein lies the problem with what could have been a dreamy, well-conceived look at life in the post-dot-com era of the Pacific Northwest--Egan strives to accomplish too much in too few pages. Rather than positioning itself as an epic tale of betrayal, love, lust, and loyalty, <i>The Winemaker's Daughter</i> never truly develops the themes that are so central to its success. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Timothy Egan is a third-generation westerner who was inspired to write this book after living in Italy for a year.

At Bristol University he studied chemistry, piano, and saxophone in equal measure, and after graduating he wrote more than 100 books on music, technology, and science, including <i>101 Great Science Experiments,</i> <i>Eyewitness: Music</i>, and <i>How Things Work</i>. By the time of his retirement he had sold around 10 million books. He died in 2004.Gr. 3-5. Many of these 101 science experiments are great, but there's also plenty of standard fare, such bottle gardens, construction of a circuit, and the perennial erupting volcano. What makes this book special is the clean, simple format with equally simple instructions. The experiments are grouped into 11 categories, including water and liquids, electricity, motion and machines, and the senses. Most of the experiments are laid out in seven steps or less. Crisp, color photographs and concise captions make each step easy to follow. Children of various ages are shown performing many of the procedures. A warning about being a safe scientist is fairly inconspicuous on the verso of the title page; a symbol for adult supervision is described there and appears throughout the text where cutting, heating, and potentially harmful substances are required. Young scientists should find plenty of ideas for experiments and activities that can be done with ordinary household items and found materials. <i>Denia Hester</i></p><h2>Robin&#39;s Laws of Good Game Mastering</h2><p>Very good condition.

First published to wide acclaim in 2002, this eye-opening book has since become a classic, promoting &#34;world-mindedness&#34; by imagining the world&#39;s population ? all 6.8 billion of us ? as a village of just 100 people. Now, If the World Were a Village has been newly revised with updated statistics, several new activities and completely new material on food security, energy and health. By exploring the lives of the 100 villagers, children will discover that life in other nations is often very different from their own. If the World Were a Village is part of CitizenKid: A collection of books that inform children about the world and inspire them to be better global citizens.</p><p>David J. Smith is a teacher and educational consultant with over 25 years of experience in the classroom and is the creator of the award-winning curriculum &#34;Mapping the World by Heart.&#34;Gr. 3-5, younger for reading aloud. To make the idea of a world of 6.2 billion people more understandable, Smith suggests that children imagine the population of the world as a village of just 100 people. That's one person representing 62 million people in the real world. Surprising, even shocking statistics follow--for example, many kids in the U. S. take computers for granted, but only seven people in the global village own one. Each double-page, picture-book spread relates a few consciousness-raising facts about such topics as nationalities, food, language, and religion. With the aid of a calculator, even younger kids can do the math; the tricky part is to get children to really understand the ideas. Armstrong's large acrylic paintings, nice complements to the text, look like stained glass windows, with blocks of intense color outlined in thick black lines. This highly informative book will get kids thinking and asking questions, and it can easily be incorporated into a middle-school social studies curriculum. The endnote suggests related activities for home and classroom. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this book,<i> </i>acclaimed historian Rashid Khalidi zeroes in on the United States&#x2019;s role as the purported impartial broker in this failed peace process. <br><br> Khalidi closely analyzes three historical moments that illuminate how the United States&#x2019; involvement has, in fact, thwarted progress toward peace between Israel and Palestine. The first moment he investigates is the &#x201c;Reagan Plan&#x201d; of 1982, when Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin refused to accept the Reagan administration&#x2019;s proposal to reframe the Camp David Accords more impartially. The second moment covers the period after the Madrid Peace Conference, from 1991 to 1993, during which negotiations between Israel and Palestine were brokered by the United States until the signing of the secretly negotiated Oslo accords. Finally, Khalidi takes on President Barack Obama&#x2019;s retreat from plans to insist on halting the settlements in the West Bank.<br><br> Through in-depth research into and keen analysis of these three moments, as well as his own firsthand experience as an advisor to the Palestinian delegation at the 1991 pre&#x2013;Oslo negotiations in Washington, DC, Khalidi reveals how the United States and Israel have actively colluded to prevent a Palestinian state and resolve the situation in Israel&#x2019;s favor. <i>Brokers of Deceit</i> bares the truth about why peace in the Middle East has been impossible to achieve: for decades, US policymakers have masqueraded as unbiased agents working to bring the two sides together, when, in fact, they have been the agents of continuing injustice, effectively preventing the difficult but essential steps needed to achieve peace in the region.</p><p><b>Rashid Khalidi </b>is the author of seven books about the Middle East, including <i>Palestinian Identity</i>,<i> Brokers of Deceit, Resurrecting Empire</i>, <i>The Iron Cage</i>, and <i>Sowing Crisis. </i>His writing on Middle Eastern history and politics has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>,<i> Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and many journals.

If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt</i><br> <i>thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even among</i><br> <i>people who should and do know better.</i><br> &#x2014;George Orwell, &#x201c;Politics and the English Language,&#x201d; 1946<br> &nbsp;<br> In politics and in diplomacy, as in much else, language matters greatly.<br> However debased political discourse may become, however disingenuous<br> diplomacy often is, the words employed by politicians and diplomats<br> defi ne situations and determine outcomes. In recent history, few<br> semantic battles over terminology have been as intensely fought out as<br> those concerning Palestine/Israel.<br> &nbsp;<br> The importance of the precise use of language can be illustrated by<br> the powerful valence in the Middle East context of terms such as &#x201c;terrorism,&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;security,&#x201d; &#x201c;self-determination,&#x201d; &#x201c;autonomy,&#x201d; &#x201c;honest broker,&#x201d;<br> and &#x201c;peace process.&#x201d; Each of these terms has set conditions not only for<br> perceptions, but also for possibilities. Moreover, these terms have come<br> to take on a specifi c meaning, frequently one that is heavily loaded in<br> favor of one side, and is far removed from what logic or balance would<br> seem to dictate. Thus in the American/Israeli offi cial lexicon, &#x201c;terrorism&#x201d;<br> in the Middle East context has come to apply <i>exclusively </i>to the<br> actions of Arab militants, whether those of the Palestine Liberation<br> Organization (PLO), Hamas, Hizballah, or others. Under these peculiar<br> terminological rules, the actions of the militaries of Israel and the<br> United States cannot be described as &#x201c;terrorism,&#x201d; irrespective of how<br> many Palestinians, Lebanese, Iraqi, or Afghan civilians may have died<br> at their hands.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Similarly, in this lexicon, &#x201c;security&#x201d; is an absolute priority of Israel&#x2019;s,<br> the need for which is invariably described as rooted in genuine, deepseated<br> existential fears. &#x201c;Israeli security&#x201d; therefore takes precedence<br> over virtually everything else, including international law and the human<br> rights of others. It is an endlessly expansive concept that includes<br> a remarkable multitude of things, such as whether pasta or generator<br> parts can be brought into the Gaza Strip, or whether miserably poor<br> Palestinian villagers can be allowed water cisterns.1 By contrast, in spite<br> of the precarious nature of their situation, Palestinians are presumed<br> not to have any signifi cant concerns about their security. This is the case<br> even though nearly half the Palestinian population have lived for more<br> than two generations under a grinding military occupation without the<br> most basic human, civil, or political rights, and the rest have for many<br> decades been dispersed from their ancestral homeland, many of them<br> living under harsh, authoritarian Arab governments.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is concerned primarily, however, not with the misuse of<br> language, important though that is, but with an American-brokered political<br> process that for more than thirty-fi ve years has reinforced the subjugation<br> of the Palestinian people, provided Israel and the United States<br> with a variety of advantages, and made considerably more unlikely the<br> prospects of a just and lasting settlement of the confl ict between Israel<br> and the Arabs. This is the true nature of this process. Were this glaring<br> reality apparent to all, there might have been pressure for change. But<br> the distortion of language has made a crucially important contribution<br> to these outcomes, by &#x201c;corrupting thought,&#x201d; and thereby cloaking their<br> real nature. As we shall see in the pages that follow, language employed<br> in the Middle East political context&#x2014;terms like &#x201c;terrorism&#x201d; and &#x201c;security&#x201d;<br> and the others mentioned above&#x2014;has often been distorted and<br> then successfully employed to conceal what was actually happening.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where the Palestinians are concerned, time and again during their<br> modern history, corrupted phraseology has profoundly obscured reality.<br> The Zionist movement decisively established a discursive hegemony<br> early on in the confl ict with the Palestinians, thereby signifi cantly reinforcing<br> the existing power balance in its favor, and later in favor of the<br> state of Israel. This has placed the Palestinians at a lasting disadvantage,<br> as they have consistently been forced to compete within a fi eld whose<br> terms are largely defi ned by their opponents. Consider such potent canards<br> as &#x201c;making the desert bloom&#x201d;&#x2014;implying that the six hundred<br> thousand industrious Palestinian peasants and townspeople who inhabited<br> their homeland in the centuries before the relatively recent arrival<br> of modern political Zionism were desert nomads and wastrels&#x2014;and &#x201c;a<br> land without a people for a people without a land,&#x201d; which presumes the<br> nonexistence of an entire people.2 As the Palestinian literary and cultural<br> critic Edward Said aptly put it in 1988: &#x201c;It is by no means an exaggeration<br> to say that the establishment of Israel as a state in 1948 occurred<br> partly because the Zionists acquired control of most of the territory of<br> Palestine, and partly because they had already won the political battle<br> for Palestine in the international world in which ideas, representation,<br> rhetoric and images were at issue.&#x201d;3</p><h2>Wait for Me!: Memoirs of the Youngest Mitford Sister</h2><p>Light wear to cover.

Years later Mabel, our parlourmaid, told me, &#x2018;I knew what it was by your father&#x2019;s face.&#x2019; When the telegram arrived Nancy announced to the others, &#x2018;We Are Seven&#x2019;, and wrote to Muv at our London house, 49 Victoria Road, Kensington, where she was lying-in, &#x2018;How disgusting of the poor darling to go and be a girl.&#x2019; Life went on as though nothing had happened and all agreed that no one, except Nanny, looked at me till I was three months old and then were not especially pleased by what they saw.</p><p>Grandfather Redesdale&#x2019;s huge house and estate in Gloucestershire, Batsford Park near Moreton-in-Marsh, was inherited by my father in 1916. It was too expensive to keep up and was sold in 1919. My father looked for somewhere more modest near Swinbrook, a small village where he owned land, fifteen miles from Batsford. There was no house there suitable for a family of six children and a seventh on the way, so he bought Asthall Manor in the neighbouring village. I was born soon after the move and my earliest recollections are of the ancient house and its immediate surroundings. Asthall is a typical Cotswold manor, hard by the church, with a garden that descends to the River Windrush. It was loved by my sisters and Tom, and the seven years spent there were probably the happiest for parents and children, the proceeds of the sale of Batsford giving the family a feeling of security that was never repeated.</p><p>There was, and is, something profoundly satisfying in the scale of Asthall village. It was a perfect entity where every element was in proportion to the rest: the manor, the vicarage, the school and pub; the farmhouses with their conveniently placed cowsheds and barns; the cottages, whose occupants supplied the labour for the centuries-old jobs that still existed when we were children; and the pigsties, chicken runs and gardens that belonged to the cottages. Before cars and commuters, you lived close to where you worked and the shops came to you in horse-drawn vans. This was the calm background of a self-contained agricultural parish, regulated by the seasons, in an exceptionally beautiful part of England.</p><p>My father planted woods to hold game, as well as a short beech avenue leading up to the house, and his dark purple lilacs outside the garden wall are still growing there after nearly a hundred years. The house itself needed much restoration. My mother&#x2019;s flair for decoration and her talent for home-making ensured that the French furniture and pictures from Batsford were shown at their best. My father installed water-powered electric light &#x2013; just the sort of contraption he adored; drawing heavily on his umpteenth cigarette, he would lean over the engineer, itching to do the job better himself. He made sure he had a child-proof door to his study by putting the handle high up out of reach. Sometimes we heard the voice of Galli-Curci singing Farve&#x2019;s favourite aria, coming loudly from the outsize horn of his gramophone &#x2013; a twin of the one in advertisements for His Master&#x2019;s Voice. In another mood he might put on &#x2018;The Diver&#x2019; (&#x2018;He is now on the surface, he&#x2019;s gasping for breath, so pale that he wants but the stillness of death&#x2019;), sung by Signor Foli in a terrifying and unnaturally low bass voice.</p><p>With foresight, or perhaps by luck, Farve converted the barn a few yards from the house into one large room with four bedrooms above and added a covered passage, &#x2018;the cloisters&#x2019;, to connect the two buildings. Tom and the older sisters lived in the barn, untroubled by grown-ups or babies, and made the most of their freedom. My father, who was famous for having read only one book, White Fang, which he enjoyed so much he vowed never to read another, entrusted Tom, aged ten, with the task of choosing which books to keep from the Batsford library. Nancy and Diana later said that if they had any education, it was due to the unrestricted access they had had to Grandfather&#x2019;s books at Asthall. Later, a grand piano arrived for Tom who showed great musical promise. Music and reading were his passions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The First World War was not long over and life for the survivors was limping back to normal. There was little to record in our family in the first few years of my life. Nancy went to Hatherop Castle, a finishing school nearby, and was taken to Paris with a group of friends, where she first saw the architecture and works of art that inspired in her a lifelong love of that city. She wrote enthusiastic letters to our mother about the shops, the food and the days spent at the Louvre. Pam busied herself with her ponies, pigs and dogs. Tom was at Lockers Park prep school in Hemel Hempstead. His orderly mind was already preparing for a career in the Law and he paid Nancy to argue with him all day during the holidays. Diana was an unwilling Girl Guide and played the organ in church, putting into practice her theory that &#x2018;Tea for Two&#x2019;, if played slowly enough, did very well as a voluntary.</p><p>The years at Asthall passed in a haze of contentment from my point of view. I was aware of The Others but they were so old and seemed to Decca (Jessica, my daily companion) and me to be of another world. It was not until later that I got to know them. Unity, next up in age from Decca and not yet in the schoolroom, made her huge presence felt but, although always kind to me, she was not an intimate. Our life in the nursery consisted of the daily round, the common task, secure and regular as clockwork.</p><p>At the age of five we started lessons with Muv, who followed the admirable Parents&#x2019; National Education Union (PNEU) system with its emphasis on learning through direct contact with nature and good books, and its disapproval of marks, prizes, rewards and exams. She taught us reading, writing and sums, and read us tales from the famous children&#x2019;s history book, Our Island Story. She was a natural teacher and never made anything seem too difficult. At the age of eight, I moved on to the schoolroom and a governess (trained at the PNEU&#x2019;s Ambleside College) and never enjoyed lessons again.</p><p>Our nursery windows overlooked the churchyard with its graves of wool merchants long since dead, the beautiful tombs topped with fleeces carved in stone. We were fascinated by funerals, which we were not meant to watch but of course we did. Decca and I once fell into a newly dug grave, to the delight of Nancy who pronounced fearful bad luck on us for ever. At that age, I was sure Farve would be buried by the path leading to our garden and even today I expect to see his big toe sticking up through the turf, which is what he warned me would happen if I misbehaved.</p><p>Beyond the churchyard to the left were stables, kennels and a garage. Early on at Asthall my father had a horrible accident in the stable yard: he was getting on to a young horse when it reared and fell backwards on to him, breaking his pelvis. The injury did not heal properly and, unable to throw his leg over a saddle, he never rode again. To the right of the churchyard was the vicarage. We adored the vicar&#x2019;s wife and long after we had left Asthall, Pam and I used to ride over and trot briskly up the drive, shouting for ginger biscuits. Across the road was the kitchen garden with its glasshouses and glorious white peaches, reserved strictly for grown-ups. Unity and our cousin Chris Bailey committed the heinous crime of sneaking into the greenhouse and stealing some peaches. There was a stony silence throughout the house while they were reprimanded by my father, which made a big effect on the younger ones. Farve has gone down in history as a violent man, mainly because of Nancy&#x2019;s portrayal of him as the irascible Uncle Matthew in her novels. While he could indeed get angry, he was never physically violent and his bark was far worse than his bite. We would tease him, goad him as far as we dared, until he turned and roared at us.</p><p>As soon as I could walk I shadowed Farve, struggling to keep up. He used to pick me up, throw me on to his shoulder and carry me over winter ditches and summer stinging nettles; the comforting feel of his velveteen waistcoat is inseparable from my memories of him. I must have been a great nuisance, but we saw eye to eye about everything. He took me fishing in the magic moment of the year when the mayfly were hatching and let me carry his net. As time went by, he showed me how to slide it under the hooked trout &#x2013; no talking, no jerking &#x2013; and land it on the bank. The sound of a reel when a line is cast on a trout rod equals early summer to me and the smell of newly cut grass, cow parsley, thrushes and &#x2018;All the birds of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire&#x2019; (Edward Thomas&#x2019;s Adlestrop is not far from Asthall) take me back to our stretch of the Windrush. No health, no safety, no handrail on the single planks that were our bridges as we crossed and recrossed over the river. It was paradise and I knew it. The river water had its own smell that rose from the easily stirred-up mud, and many years later when swimming among the weeds and mud in a pond high above Chatsworth, in the company of moorhens and mallard, nostalgia for the river at Asthall was almost too much and I was six again.</p><p>My father loved the river, described in the estate agent&#x2019;s brochure when Asthall was sold as &#x2018;of the most attractive character to a fisherman, including rapids, ge...</p></p><h2>Always Looking: Essays on Art</h2><p><p>In this posthumous collection of John Updike&#x2019;s art writings, a companion volume to the acclaimed <i>Just Looking </i>(1989) and <i>Still Looking</i> (2005), readers are again treated to &#x201c;remarkably elegant essays&#x201d; (<i>Newsday</i>) in which &#x201c;the psychological concerns of the novelist drive the eye from work to work until a deep understanding of the art emerges&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>). <br><br> <i> Always Looking </i>opens with &#x201c;The Clarity of Things,&#x201d; the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities for 2008. Here, in looking closely at individual works by Copley, Homer, Eakins, Norman Rockwell, and others, the author teases out what is characteristically &#x201c;American&#x201d; in American art. This talk is followed by fourteen essays, most of them written for <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, on certain highlights in Western art of the last two hundred years: the iconic portraits of Gilbert Stuart and the sublime landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church, the series paintings of Monet and the monotypes of Degas, the richly patterned canvases of Vuillard and the golden extravagances of Klimt, the cryptic triptychs of Beckmann, the personal graffiti of Mir�, the verbal-visual puzzles of Magritte, and the monumental Pop of Oldenburg and Lichtenstein. The book ends with a consideration of recent works by a living American master, the steely sculptural environments of Richard Serra. <br><br> John Updike was a gallery-goer of genius. <i>Always Looking</i> is, like everything else he wrote, an invitation to look, to <i>see,</i> to apprehend the visual world through the eyes of a connoisseur.</p></p><p>John Updike was the author of more than sixty books, including twenty-three novels and dozens of collections of short stories, poems, and criticism. His work has been honored with the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Gold Medal for Fiction of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He died in January 2009.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Christopher Carduff is a member of the staff of The Library of America and the editor of John Updike&#x2019;s <i>Higher Gossip: Essays and Criticism.</i>In the third volume of his Looking series of art-essay collections, following Just Looking (1989) and Still Looking (2005), and published posthumously, Updike expands on his articulation of the complex pleasures of intense scrutiny. He is sensuously receptive and discerningly critical as he peers closely and steps back for a more encompassing gaze to assess how each artist brings paint to life. Most of the essays are scintillating and learned biographical and aesthetic responses to major museum exhibits of such artists as �douard Vuillard, Ren� Magritte, Max Beckmann, Joan Mir�, and Richard Serra. But in &#x201c;The Clarity of Things,&#x201d; his 2008 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, Updike discusses Picturing America&#x2014;a set of 40 reproductions created by the American Library Association and the National Endowment for the Humanities for use in schools and libraries, taking fresh approaches to Gilbert Stuart, Winslow Homer, and Norman Rockwell and posing and answering the question, &#x201c;What is American about American art?&#x201d; For all their immediacy, Updike&#x2019;s vital works of art criticism are timeless. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Arte Povera: Movements in Modern Art</h2><p>In 1967 the critic Germano Celant coined the term Arte Povera to describe the work of Italian artists making use of simple materials to achieve their artistic statements in a reaction against the commercial pressures of the art market in the late 1960s. Artists associated with Arte Povera include Luciano Fabro, Giulio Paolini, Jannia Kounellis, Mario Merz, and Alighiero Boetti. The term has subsequently been used to describe work in a wide range of mediums, including sculpture, installation, Land Art, and performance. <br><br>In this fully illustrated survey, Robert Lumley provides a concise and accessible account of the phenomenon of Arte Povera. He identifies key events in the history of the movement and explains the cultural context that gave rise to it and its abiding influence on art today. This is the ideal book for anyone who wants to explore one of the formative movements in the development of contemporary art.

Fuentes, who was born in Berlin, Germany, came to the US with her immediate family to escape the Holocaust. Her memoirs reveal how the five-year-old immigrant in 1934 became the first woman attorney in the Office of the General Counsel at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1965, one of the founders of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966, the highest-paid woman at the headquarters of two multinational corporations: GTE and TRW, and an international speaker on womens rights for the US Information Agency. <br><br> The story begins with the wedding of Fuentes parents, Hinda and Zysia Pressman, in Piltz, a town in Poland. It goes on to the adventures of the Pressmans and Fuentes in Berlin, Antwerp, the Bronx, the Catskills, Miami Beach, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Stamford (Connecticut), and Washington, DC. Along the way, Fuentes had encounters with Pat Ward (a notorious call girl in the 50s), Betty Friedan, Harry Golden, Dr. Cecil Jacobson (a prominent geneticist convicted on fifty-two counts of perjury and fraud), and many others. At forty-two, she married a handsome Puerto Rican and 1 years later, her Puerto Rican Jewish daughter was born. She tells about it all in Eat First. <br><br> "I walk in the footprints of Sonia Pressman Fuentes." <br><br> --Patricia Ireland, president, NOW <br><br> "Evoking a tear here and a chuckle there, with her heart- <br><br> warming wit and wisdom, Sonia Pressman Fuentes recounts the story of a Jewish family, her family, from her grandparents origin in a shtettl in Poland right through her own career as a founder of NOW and beyond." <br><br> --Gus Tyler, columnist, contributing editor, The Forward <br><br> "Sonia Pressman Fuentes played a major role in the birth of the new womens movement and her tales of its early days will delight historians and those who are curious about the beginnings of this great social movement.

In 1996, she received the Veteran Feminists of America Medal of Honor.EAT FIRST--YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL GIVE YOU, The Adventures of an Immigrant Family and Their Feminist Daughter, by Sonia Pressman Fuentes is the story of an extraordinary woman at an extraordinary time in our country's history. It is the story of a five-year-old immigrant girl who came to this country with her family to escape the Holocaust and grew up to become a founder of the Second Wave of the women's movement. <p>Ms. Fuentes is a natural storyteller and through her tales and anecdotes we come to know her parents, her brother, and Sonia, herself. The tale begins with her father's running away from his own wedding in a small Polish town, only to be rounded up by incensed village folk determined that a wedding would take place. It moves on to Sonia's birth and the family's flight from the Nazi reign of terror in 1930s Germany, first to Belgium and then to the United States. We come to know her family through the wry humor and warm understanding of the author and feel we know them as we would our own next-door neighbors. Our heroine does, indeed, survive being a stranger in a strange land, grows up, goes to college and then law school and becomes one of the founding mothers of the National Organization for Women and a champion of women's rights in the primary government agency charged with enforcing those rights. Along the way, she gets married, has a child, gets divorced, raises her daughter as a single mother, and is one of the forces for change in women's status that sweep this country in the 1960s and '70s. Her unique family and perspective shine in these memoirs and the reader feels a kinship with her and her family's struggles, their love, and their determination because it speaks to us all of our own. -- <i>Becky Barbour, Writer and Book Reviewer, Columbus, Ohio</i></p></p><h2>Japans First Modern Novel: Ukigumo</h2><p>First edition hardcover.

Realizing the benefits of being thought a god, Cook did nothing to dispel the misconception. Although most of his crew thoroughly enjoyed the pleasures offered by the island paradise, some men, including Ship's Master William Bligh (later captain of H.M.S. <i>Bounty</i>) and the American colonist John Ledyard, feared and resented the false position taken by their practical captain. In the quiet rebellion that followed, Captain Cook, a scientist and a man of reason, would not be persuaded by the convictions of his religious antagonist, who believed the mission doomed to failure because of his blasphemous acts. The accuracy of their predictions is left for the reader to decide.<br><br>The story is told by Jonathan Forrest, a midshipman on Cook's flagship, the <i>Resolution.</i> Through his eyes are shown many scenes of shipboard and island life, the thoughts and actions of the ill-fated captain, and the events leading ultimately to the tragedy which affected the first Europeans to visit the Hawaiian Islands.</p></p><p><b>O.A.

The story is narrated by two very different teenagers, who each inhabit two extraordinarily different worlds. Arianrhod Hyde&#39;s world (or Roddy, as she prefers to be called) is very much the world of magic, pageantry and ritual. Not unlike Britain in King Arthur&#39;s Day, Roddy is daughter of two Court Wizards and therefore part of the King&#39;s Progress, travelling round the Islands of Blest and ready to take part in whatever ritual or ceremony is required, as it occurs. Presiding over all, the most important person is the Merlin, who is entrusted with the magical health of the Isles of Blest. Nick Mallory&#39;s world is much more familiar -- at least, it starts off being our own. But it soon transpires that Nick&#39;s not quite the ordinary 15 year old he seems, as he slips sideways into something he thinks is a dream -- but in fact is another world entirely. Now, Nick&#39;s been on other worlds before (although never alone) but he&#39;s a confident type. Maybe a bit too confident! In Roddy&#39;s world, the current Merlin expires and a new one takes his place. Yet something is wrong -- the rituals have been upset and nothing is going the way it should. Roddy needs help, and certain powers indicate that Nick is to be the one to help her. And Nick is cool about helping her -- in theory! but it&#39;s a bit worrying that she seems to mistake him for a magic-user. Their stories unfold, side-by-side, each part leading into the next, and the Merlin Conspiracy thickens as the tales swirl around each other -- twining, meeting and affecting each other, yet never completely combining until the very end chapters when all is finally revealed. Compelling, howlingly funny in places, mind-boggling -- this is going to WOW DWJ fans all around the world (and probably in other universes too).</p><p>Master fantasist Diana Wynne Jones--author of the Chrestomanci books, <i>Dark Lord of Derkholm</i>, <i>Year of the Griffin</i>, and many others--scores another winner in this absorbing tale of magic and courtly intrigue told in two voices. In the world called Islands of the Blest, Roddy is a young page who has grown up traveling with her family in the King&#x2019;s Progress, a constant journey around the kingdom. Just after she and her younger friend Grundo spot a growing conspiracy to overthrow the King and change the balance of magic, they are whisked away to visit Roddy&#x2019;s grim and silent grandfather; when they return the Progress has moved on without them. Meanwhile in another world, Nick Mallory, 14, blunders into a dreamlike adventure that leads him to the powerful wizard Romanov and involves him in Roddy&#x2019;s mission to save the worlds from the upset planned by the conspiracy. The story moves through several precariously linked worlds in vividly imagined episodes told alternately by Roddy and Nick, as their journeys begin to mesh. Part of the fun for the reader is sorting out Roddy&#x2019;s many wizardly relatives from the double perspective and clicking them into place in the plot. Wynne Jones's many fans will pounce on this complex but fast-moving fantasy that features not only 34 characters, but a panther, a goat, a dragon, and an extremely charming elephant.

Daisy meets all these characters and observes the ensuing familial fraternization with a certain kind of amusing nonchalance. That is, until Lucy's great aunt is found strangled to death in her bed. Lucy, in the meantime, has arranged to meet her betrothed in the conservatory, but when she arrives she finds him trying to revive her uncle, who has died-or has he been murdered? And just like that a normally celebratory occasion turns suspicious. Now Daisy must sift through a throng of relatives-aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents- once wedding guests and now murder suspects. And she must find the killer quickly before another family member becomes a corpse.<br></p><p>Carola Dunn is the author of many previous mysteries featuring Daisy Dalrymple as well as numerous historical novels. Born and raised in England, she lives in Eugene, Oregon. <br>&nbsp; <p><b>A Mourning Wedding</b></p>1<i>"D</i>arling, I wish you hadn't planned a <i>morning</i> wedding. I'm getting the most frightful morning sickness these days. I'm more likely to need support than to be able to support you." Daisy reached for another buttery toasted teacake."Bosh!" Blood red nail varnish gleamed as Lucy deftly slid the willow-pattern plate on its lace doily across the dark oak table, away from Daisy. "You're as healthy as a horse.""I'm eating for two," Daisy protested. "And making up for lost time, too. You haven't seen me between seven and eleven in the morning. I can barely manage to down a cup of tea for breakfast.""Too sickening, darling!" Lucy said sardonically, her clear soprano turning heads as it rang through the small tea-shop.It was all very well for her. She never had the least difficulty keeping the straight-up-and-down figure--still fashionable in 1924, alas--which Daisy would never attain. But Lucy moved the plate back within Daisy's reach before pouring herself a second cup of Earl Grey.Daisy didn't care for Earl Grey at the best of times. Now the musky scent gave her a twinge of incipient nausea. She hastily took another teacake, the smells of cinnamon and nutmeg bringing comfort to her queasy stomach. The Cosy Corner didn't put in as much spice as the Bluebell Tea Rooms used to, she thought regretfully, but after what happened at the Bluebell she'd never been quite brave enough to go back.She turned her attention back to her friend. As always, Lucy was the epitome of the stylish young woman, from the feathered cloche perched on her dark, sleek bob to the fashionable knee-length hemline, flesh-coloured silk stockings, and strapped shoes below.Usually cool, calm and collected, she was now fidgeting with her teaspoon, although she didn't take sugar in her tea. She regarded Daisy with uncharacteristic anxiety and lowered her voice to say, "For a moment there you looked quite green. Darling, will it really be too much for you to come to Haverhill a few days early?""Everyone says morning sickness only lasts a month, or six weeks at most. The trouble is, they say it in that frightfully hearty, encouraging way that makes one sure they're concealing the bad news.""The wedding's not for another month. I don't know how I'll cope without you to rely on for a breath of sanity, Daisy. All the family will be gathering, and besides the general fuss, some of my relations are utterly poisonous.""Her brothers and her cousins, whom she reckons up by dozens, her brothers and her cousins and her aunts!" Daisy misquoted <i>HMS Pinafore.</i> "I suppose you're getting married at Haverhill rather than in town because Lord Haverhill's getting a bit creaky about the joints?""Actually, Grandfather may be eighty but he's as frisky as a spring lamb, and Grandmama too.""I can't imagine Lady Haverhill frisking!""No, much too Victorian, but she's healthy as a horse. They both adore any excuse to gather the whole family at Haverhill. It's Uncle Aubrey who has a dicky heart, though I don't believe it's quite as bad as Aunt Maud likes to think.""I seem to remember Lady Fotheringay being a bit of a worrier." "Fussbox, more like," said Lucy with an unladylike snort. "Cosseting him makes her feel important.""It must be difficult playing second fiddle for decades," Daisy said charitably. "She'd like to be the Countess of Haverhill before your uncle pops off, I expect. It's only natural. I suppose Lady Eva will be there. She rather terrifies me. I'm always sure she's reading my mind.""Oh, Aunt Eva doesn't need supernatural means to collect her information. She's a bit of a bore but really quite a decent old trout.""I bet there are a lot of people who feel threatened by her curiosity. People who have something they desperately want to hide.""It's not as if she ever does anything with what she finds out. She just likes to know what everyone's up to. Our sort of people, I mean. She couldn't care less about Mr. Bones the Butcher.""It wouldn't surprise me if she found out I was pregnant before I did! Or did she lose interest in me when I married a policeman?""It was touch and go," Lucy said frankly, "but your mother is still the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and your sister's Lady John. In spite of which you might have been relegated to <i>hoi polloi</i> if Alec was an ordinary bobby, not a Detective Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. His title may not be noble but it has a certain lustre."Daisy laughed. "That's all that reconciled Mother to my marriage, insofar as she's ever reconciled to anything once she's decided to disapprove. At least your relatives, however poisonous, can't possibly disapprove of Binkie.""No," Lucy agreed complacently, leaning back in the high-backed Windsor chair. "The son of a marquis, even a younger son, is a creditable match.""Lucy, you do love him, don't you?""I ... I think so. I'm pretty certain, actually. I'm not likely to find anyone else who's willing to let me keep up the photography business after we're married.""You can wind him around your little finger." Disturbed by her friend's attitude, Daisy sighed."One can't ever be absolutely certain, can one?" Lucy pleaded."I am. Most of the time, anyway. Right-oh, darling, I'll come to Haverhill to hold your hand and cheer you on. Maybe I can get an article out of it for my American editor: 'A Fashionable English Wedding,' perhaps.""Thanks, darling." Lucy took out her compact to powder her nose and refresh her crimson lip-salve. "I've got to run. Lady Moresby wants yet another portrait, though I can't think why, considering her face. But she says I'm the only photographer who brings out her 'inner being.' By the way, not a word about the photography. The parents assume I'm going to give up the studio once I'm Lady Gerald Bincombe.""I'll be silent as the grave," Daisy promised.<br>&nbsp;On a sunny afternoon in June, Lord Haverhill's dark blue Daimler sped between the flat, emerald green fields of Cambridgeshire. Leaning back in the luxuriously soft leather seat she shared with a hamper from Fortnum and Mason, Daisy caught a glimpse to her right of their goal.Her stepdaughter, Belinda, would love to see Haverhill, she thought. At this distance, the mansion resembled an exotic hybrid of a medi�val castle and a Gothic cathedral. The sprawling mass, complete with towers and spires, turrets and battlements, oriels and arches, was a triumph of early Victorian neo-Gothic.One of the two tallest spires belonged to the chapel where Lucy would be married. In Victorian times, the entire household, including throngs of servants, had gathered there for daily prayers. Nowadays it saw a Sunday service only when a clergyman was visiting, as the present Lord Haverhill had no private chaplain.Turning off a narrow lane, the motor-car approached the mansion along an avenue of elms. The grounds visible between the trees were well-kept parkland with scattered trees and a spinney off to the right. None of the fallow deer Daisy remembered were visible.The Daimler drew up before the broad flight of marble steps leading up to the cathedral-sized front door. The chauffeur came around to open Daisy's door.She stepped out and paused to contemplate the vast fa�ade. Not having visited for a while, she had forgotten how enormous the house was. From here, only the main block was visible, but that alone could have swallowed Alec's suburban semi-detached without a hiccup. Altogether, Haverhill was at least twice, perhaps three times, the size of Fairacres, Daisy's childhood home.As she started up the steps, Lucy came out through a wicket in the great double door and hurried down to meet her. Elegant as ever in a simple summer frock of buttercup yellow linen, belted at the hips with a white sash, she made Daisy feel crumpled and dusty. Behind her, a woman with mousy marcelled hair paused on the top step, watching."Darling, I hope the journey wasn't too frightfully tiresome. I managed to escape to the library ...""The library? You?" Daisy said, laughing." ... To watch out for you." Lucy gestured at the windows to their left. "No one but John is ever there--you know we're not a bookish family--but Sally saw me go in and followed. She's trying to persuade me to let her little darling carry my train. I'm supposed to make an exception because the brat will be Earl of Haverhill in fifty years or so.""Sally is your cousin Rupert's wife, I take it?""Yes. Then there are my sisters-in-law who think their offspring should have precedence, and Mummy, who agrees on no children in the wedding but wants me to carry tuberoses, which always make me sneeze, and ...""Darling, you're babbling.""I'm well on the way to becoming a raving lunatic. Thank heaven you've come, Daisy.""Introduce me to Mrs. Rupert and then you'll have to escort me to my room for a lie-down before tea. I'm quite exhausted from the journey."Lucy peered into her face, concerned. "You don't look ... Oh, you mean ... Right-oh." She raised her voice. "Sally, I don't believe you've met my friend Daisy Fletcher."Mrs. Rupert Fotheringay's tweed skirt, silk blouse, and pearls, though perfectly suitable for the country, looked formal beside Lucy's frock, and her tone was more formal than friendly as she said, "Welcome to Haverhill, Mrs. Fletcher.""I'm taking Daisy up to her room to rest after the journey.""That hardly seems necessary as your grandfather sent the Daimler for her." The tone was distinctly chilly now. "Those of us who came down by train--""Daisy's pregnant," Lucy announced baldly. "Her husband wouldn't let her come if she had to take the train.""The car didn't come just for me. It was crammed full of parcels for the wedding," Daisy explained."Come on, darling, before you drop." Lucy linked her arm through Daisy's and practically dragged her into the house. "Sally is jealous," she hissed, "because this time I'm the bride who gets all the attention, and I'm getting a bigger show than she did. Heaven knows I could do without it! If I'd realized what a big family wedding entails, I'd have made Binkie elope to Gretna."The hall was cavernous, lit high above by windows in the octagonal base of the clock tower. Between the surrounding marble pillars lurked portraits by Van Dyck, Lely and Raeburn. Daisy and Lucy picked their way across the chequerboard marble floor between stacks of trestle tables and folding chairs."Good gracious, how many people are coming?""Six hundred to the breakfast, most of them relatives. My great-grandfather had thirteen children, all dead but three, but there's their children and children's children. Then there's Mummy's side of the family. And Binkie's mother's guest list was almost as long as ours. Grandfather's paying for the lot, the lamb, not expecting Daddy to cough up out of his own pocket.""That's jolly generous.""Oh, he has pots of money. In spite of--or perhaps because of--all those children, my great-grandfather popped off before ruinous death duties came in.""Helpful of him!""Very. Mind you, Grandfather has plenty of expenses what with all the people battening on him. Not only those living here. Great-uncle Montagu gets enough income from the estate to live on. And Grandfather gives Uncle Henry and Daddy allowances, and Rupert too, because he's the eldest son of the eldest son. Girls are supposed to stay at home until they marry.""Don't I know it!" Daisy had been expected to reside with her mother or the cousin who inherited Fairacres when her father and brother died. Like Lucy, she had chosen to earn her own living, in her case with writing, and they had shared digs. "It was fun, but I have to confess I did get fearfully tired of living on eggs and sardines and mousetrap cheese.""It's no fun without you, darling. But no more of that from now on. Binkie gets an allowance from his father, and he's doing surprisingly well in the City. You're all right with stairs, aren't you, darling?" Lucy asked as they reached the splendidly carved oak staircase, saved from the demolition of the ancient house which once stood on this spot. "Grandmama told Jennifer to put you in the room next to mine. First floor, not too much climbing.""I'm perfectly well, now that the beastly morning sickness is over. But thanks all the same.""Lucy!" Lady Fotheringay came out of the dining room to their right. A short, plump, grey-haired lady, she was aflutter with gauzy draperies in a variety of pastel shades. "Lucy, such a shame ... Oh, it's Daisy Dalrymple isn't it? How lovely to see you again, my dear. But you're married now, aren't you. Perhaps I ought to call you Mrs. Fletcher?""Daisy will do very well, Lady Fotheringay.""What was it you wanted to tell me, Aunt Maud?" Lucy demanded with barely concealed impatience."Oh yes. Your uncle is very much afraid he won't have any pineapples ripe by Saturday.""I'm sure there's plenty of other fruit, cherries and such, or you can send to London. Excuse us, please, Aunt. Daisy needs to rest before tea."Daisy glanced back with a smile of apology as Lucy bustled her up the stairs. Lady Fotheringay appeared undismayed by her niece's rudeness, but Daisy protested, "Lucy, you're being quite as poisonous as any of your relatives can possibly be. I won't be turned into an invalid just so that you can avoid them.""Sorry, darling! I'll grovel to Aunt Maud, I promise, but not to Sally, who was foul to you first.""She was rather. Pineapples--Your uncle's still mad for his conservatories, I take it?""Yes. Uncle Aubrey's a dear old bird but mad is the word, quite potty, in fact. I told you he has a weak heart? Sometimes I wonder if his brain isn't getting enough blood. At least he sticks to his plants and doesn't fuss at me. Oh Lord, now here comes Grandmama!"The Countess of Haverhill was a tall, upright old lady dressed in the black her generation considered suitable for the elderly. "Welcome back to Haverhill, Mrs. Fletcher," she said. "I trust you will be a calming influence on Lucy. Nerves were expected of a bride in my day, but I thought you modern young people were supposed to be above such weaknesses.""I dare say it takes everyone differently, Lady Haverhill.""No doubt." She looked beyond Daisy and frowned slightly. "What is it, Jennifer?""Mrs. Oliver wants Lucy to try on her going-away costume, Lady Haverhill." A woman came hurrying down the upper staircase, by no means so grand as the lower. Her slightly shabby clothes could have been Sally Fotheringay's cast-offs, and very likely were. A niece of Lady Fotheringay, she had married a penniless war refugee from somewhere in Europe."Again?" Lucy heaved a big sigh. "In the sewing room? Tell Mummy I'll be along as soon as I've settled Daisy, will you, Jennifer?""Hello, Jennifer," said Daisy."Hello, Daisy. Shall I show you your room while Lucy goes to her mother?"Lucy opened her mouth to object, caught her grandmother's eye, sighed again, and acquiesced."I hope to see you at tea, Mrs. Fletcher," said Lady Haverhill, "if you feel up to coming down.""I'll be there, never fear." Daisy walked with Jennifer along the car...</p><h2>Death by the Bay (A Dave Cubiak Door County Mystery)</h2><p>On a chilly Monday in late spring, Sheriff Dave Cubiak is at the Green Arbor Lodge for lunch when a scream from a nearby medical conference disrupts the scene.

Edgar Hoover&#39;s &#34;Top Hoodlum Program.&#34; He masterminded the first electronic surveillance of a Mafia headquarters. Sam Giancana put a $100,000 contract on his life. Now, Bill Roemer, the FBI crime expert who&#39;s had more face-to-face confrontations with mobsters than anyone in law enforcement history, tells his electrifying life story. From his key role in the lives of John and Robert Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Phyllis McGuire, and Marilyn Monroe, to the run ins with Anthony &#34;Tony Batters&#34; Accardo, Murray &#34;The Camel&#34; Humphreys and Jackie Cerone that made him the nemesis of the Chicago mob, here is a chillingly authentic account that ranks as one of the finest chronicles in true crime.</p><p>"Roemer does an admirable job of bluntly recreating the inner workings of Chicago's underworld and the FBI's methods of fighting them....A revealing memoir that pulls no punches in recalling the triumphs -- and, at times, foul-ups -- that characterized Mr. Roemer's remarkable career."<p>The New York Times Book Review</p>The author, who runs a private investigating agency in Tucson that specializes in organized crime, spent 30 years as an FBI agent, mostly in Chicago. He writes that although innumerable opportunities to rise in the hierarchy came his way, he preferred to remain on the street, taking on the mob. Roemer's particular concern as an agent was to track corrupt public officials who were vital to the success of the "family." Here he recalls his mob dealings, from 1950 to 1980, with Sam Giancana, Murray Humphreys (successor to Capone lieutenant Jake Guzik), Tony Accardo and dozens of others. Distinguishing between "good" bad guys who could be trusted, and "bad" bad guys, he shows that some gangland figures virtually became his friends. His intimate knowledge of them enriches the book. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>John Constantine: Hellblazer - City of Demons</h2><p>A new adventure starring Vertigo&#x2019;s longest running antihero, John Constantine, England&#x2019;s chain-smoking, low-rent magus, featuring artwork by Sean Murphy, illustrator of JOE THE BARBARIAN.

For four years the fighting now turned into a siege on a quite monstrous scale. Europe became the focus of fighting of a kind previously unimagined. Despite local successes - and an apparent triumph in Russia - Germany and Austria-Hungary were never able to break out of the the Allies&#39; ring of steel. In Alexander Watson&#39;s compelling new history of the Great War, all the major events of the war are seen from the perspective of Berlin and Vienna. It is fundamentally a history of ordinary people. In 1914 both empires were flooded by genuine mass enthusiasm and their troubled elites were at one with most of the population. But the course of the war put this under impossible strain, with a fatal rupture between an ever more extreme and unrealistic leadership and an exhausted and embittered people. In the end they failed and were overwhelmed by defeat and revolution.</p><p>Alexander Watson is Lecturer of History at Goldsmiths, University of London. He has been a Research Fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge, a British Academy Postgraduate Fellow at the University of Cambridge and, from 2011-13, Marie Curie Inter-European Fellow at Warsaw University. His first book, Enduring the Great War, won the Fraenkel Prize.In a year dominated by memories of the First World War, this supremely accomplished book stands out. Not only does it look at the conflict from the perspective of the losing Central Powers, imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary, but it brings together political, military, economic and cultural history in an enormously impressive narrative. Although Watson&#39;s book is based on archival research in Germany, Austria and Poland, his scholarship is never suffocating. His accounts of the terrible struggle on the vast Eastern Front are brisk and well-judged, while he is particularly good at bringing alive the mood on the German and Austrian home fronts, from soldiers&#39; letters to children&#39;s nursery rhymes. Above all, his book could not be a more powerful reminder that, as bad as the war was for Britain, it was far, far worse for the losers -- Dominic Sandbrook * Sunday Times, History Book of the Year 2014 * Will be revelatory to most British readers -- Simon Heffer * New Statesman BOOKS OF THE YEAR * British historians have tended to view the Great War predominantly from the side of the Allies. Watson has done our understanding an inestimable service by examining these familiar events from the perspective of the Central Powers ... Watson&#39;s shift of perspective offers illuminating sidelights ... Watson&#39;s balance is at its most strikingly effective in a superlative chapter on Germany&#39;s catastrophic decision to launch its U-boat campaign. But it is the lost hordes of East European refugees who create the most haunting images in the immense canvas of this outstanding book -- Miranda Seymour * Telegraph * A truly indispensable contribution . . . It is a mark of talent in a historian to take familiar narratives and open them to new interpretation. Mr. Watson&#39;s book is a brilliant demonstration of this skill . . . Ring of Steel is a history as much of the emotions that hardship and war produced as of politics or diplomacy . . . Watson manages to mesh his dense bottom-up description with the grand narrative of the war&#39;s key moments of decision -- Adam Tooze * Wall Street Journal * An immensely authoritative new history of Germany and Austria-Hungary between 1914 and 1918. Watson writes fluently and compellingly, and his remarkable command of the sources offers new insight and information on almost every page. Soundly judged on the many controversial aspects of his topic, Watson is particularly ground-breaking in evoking the popular experience of the conflict and when investigating the atrocities that all too frequently were its accompaniment -- David Stevenson (author of 1914-1918) In Ring of Steel Alexander Watson shows us what it was like to be pierced by the sharp end of the Allied juggernaut. He takes us on an illuminating tour of the German and Austrian trenches, their querulous headquarters, their cold, starving towns, and their increasingly desperate government ministries. This is a fascinating account of the Great War from &#39;the other side of the hill,&#39; but also an explanation for the chaos that followed: communism, fascism, depression, and Europe&#39;s plunge into a Second World War -- Geoffrey Wawro (author of A Mad Catastrophe) The Central Powers&#39; Great War was not waged from the top down. Instead, as Alexander Watson&#39;s comprehensively researched and clearly presented analysis demonstrates, in both Germany and Austria-Hungary popular support was vital to mobilizing and sustaining an increasingly-futile conflict -- Dennis Showalter (author of Tannenberg: Clash of Empires 1914) An immensely authoritative new history of Germany and Austria-Hungary between 1914 and 1918.

Yet what we see of them in the media, more often than not, are tableaux vivantes connoting poverty, dependence, and desperation. Wangari Maathai presents a different vision, informed by her three decades as an environmental activist and campaigner for democracy. She illuminates the complex and dynamic nature of the continent, and offers &#x201c;hardheaded hope&#x201d; and &#x201c;realistic options&#x201d; for change and improvement. With clarity of expression, Maathai analyzes the most egregious &#x201c;bottlenecks to development in Africa,&#x201d; occurring at the international, national, and individual levels--cultural upheaval and enduring poverty among them--and deftly describes what Africans can and need to do for themselves, stressing all the while responsibility and accountability.</p> <p>Impassioned and empathetic, <i>The Challenge for Africa</i> is a book of immense importance. </p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Wangari Maathai</strong> <p></p> <p><b>Question:</b> Why did you decide to write about Africa?</p> <p><b>Wangari Maathai:</b> I had been working in Africa for thirty-five years, and at all levels of society--in the academy and at the grassroots, as an activist and in the government, as a human rights advocate and an environmentalist. My experience is that dealing with the issues requires a holistic approach and a broad understanding of the issues at play, so that one feels challenged to keep going rather than giving up. I wanted to share my experience with others who, like me, want to see a better Africa. I hope that reading of my experience will help them understand why things are the way they are.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You place as much blame on Africa&#x2019;s post-independence leaders as on the legacy of colonialism for the failure of Africa to progress, and strongly advocate for better leadership. How do you feel this will be accomplished?</p> <p> <b>WM:</b> First and foremost, it is important for the African leadership to let go of the excuse of the legacy of colonialism, and to accept that it is many decades since the colonial powers left Africa and some of the expectations of the African people should have been realized. It is the people in charge of the countries that should have made that possible, expcially since many of them were educated, enlightened, well-traveled, and well-exposed. Their people, however, were largely just the reverse and so put a lot of their faith in their leaders. My experience is that it is the leaders who let their people down, and it is they who must make a decision to work for their people. That is more likely to happen than their people having the capacity to hold them accountable and therefore to change the status quo. That&#x2019;s why I emphasize leadership.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You emphasize the loss of culture as one reason why Africa is not progressing. Why is this important?</p> <p> <b>WM:</b> Every people in the world has a code of wisdom they have developed out of their experiences over the course of time. That code of wisdom is reflected in their ways of life: their worship practices; their sense of justice and fairness; their agriculture and the food they eat; their biological heritage and environment; their songs, language, and dances; and the way they mourn their dead and celebrate life. All of these are what we mean when we talk about the culture of a people. </p> <p>The reason why I think culture is important in Africa, especially south of the Sahara, is that peoples&#x2019; cultures were deliberately demonized, trivialized, and destroyed, and people were encouraged to embrace a culture that was largely Western. Now the problem is that, when you deny people their cultural heritage, you render them vulnerable and make them feel inadequate. They become people with no ground to stand on, and they are disempowered. That is what happened to Africa during the colonial period, and because the cultures of Africans were largely unwritten when they got their independence, it was very difficult to go back to the pre-colonial cultures, and to a large extent many of them died with their ancestors. Because the people who were given power by the colonial administrators were devoted convertees to Western culture, they imposed that culture even more on their peoples. </p> <p>As a result, when we look back and try to deal with the challenges that confront us, we don&#x2019;t have one of the very important platforms we need to stand on to start. When I compare the experience of sub-Saharan Africa with Africa to the north, the reason why the northern Africans seem to have been able to pull out of the colonial legacy better than the southerners is, in my opinion, probably because they have a culture that is written, that wasn&#x2019;t completely destroyed, and even if the colonial power tried they were able to resist. India also seemed to deal better with their post-colonial period than Sub-Saharan Africa. Gandhi removed his three-piece suit (which represented Western success) and put on a dhoti; he ate Indian food and adopted the symbol of the spinning wheel--all to appeal to the Indian peoples&#x2019; sense of themselves and their rich, written culture. This gives me reason to question aloud, and encourage Africans to do the same, whether culture may be a missing link in Africa&#x2019;s failure to progress. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> You examine the negative perspective of Africa that is present in Western media. What do you believe the West doesn&#x2019;t understand about Africa?</p> <p> <b>WM:</b> I think there are people who understand Africa but like to present it in a distorted fashion. I also believe there are people who genuinely want to understand Africa, but don&#x2019;t because they look at Africa through the eyes of the Western media. The African media are not able to penetrate the Western media to give their own story, and even if they did, sometimes that media are already very pro-West, because the journalists have been educated and acculturated in the West and are unable to present Africa as it really is. </p> <p>Quite often in the case of Africa, people will just present one aspect--for example, poverty--without having the time or patience to explain that poverty is manmade and created both by the local leadership and the international community in the way it deals with Africa. A Western person looking at poverty makes a judgment, without understanding that that poverty is partly caused by the way their government is dealing with Africa. Another good example is the debt issue. Many of us who wanted to campaign for debt cancellation came to appreciate that Africa has already paid the principal on the debt many times over, but the way the debt was structured, Africa was going to pay it through several generations. This is unfair and exploitative. Yet most Westen people are only told that Africans have borrowed and are refusing to pay the money. They don&#x2019;t get the whole truth. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> African leaders often use the phrase &#x201c;African solutions to African problems.&#x201d; Do you support this idea?</p> <p> <b>WM:</b> I&#x2019;ve yet to see it applied. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> You seem optimistic about Africa&#x2019;s future, despite entrenched challenges. Why?</p> <p> <b>WM:</b> I would have to accept defeat if, after so many years of committing myself to Africa, I arrived at the conclusion that Africa cannot be saved. My personality is that of an optimist, because I believe that almost every problem has a solution. There are very, very few problems in life that have no solution whatsoever. Where there is a will and a commitment we can always find a solution. I do believe Africa can change. I am an African, I am highly educated; I was educated in the West, I went back home. I worked at all levels of development--among the rich and poor. </p> <p>If I was able to change and was willing to devote my life to trying to improve Africans&#x2019; quality of life and, in spite of all the obstacles, was able to accomplish some measure of success, which even the world came to recognize, why not another person? And not just two people, but four--and then a critical mass of Africans who think like me in every other African country? If that happened, we could change; indeed, it is how things change. There are countries who have been poor, colonized, and enslaved, and they have been able to get out of that situation--mostly due to the kind of leadership they enjoyed. I don&#x2019;t believe that other people have a monopoly of good leaders. I know I&#x2019;m not alone. We need to speak out. We need to hold our leaders accountable, so they can stop dividing us along ethnic and economic lines, and begin uniting us so we can have a respectable place at the table of the nations of the world. </p> <p>(Photo � Brigitte Lacombe) </p><b>Wangari Maathai</b> was elected to Kenya&#x2019;s parliament in 2002 and in 2003 was appointed Assistant Minister for Environment, Natural Resources, and Wildlife.

Antigravity technology, originally spearheaded by scientists in Nazi Germany, was another high priority, one that still may be in effect today.

The pressure to be the first nation to harness gravity is immense, as it means having the ability to build military planes of unlimited speed and range, along with the most deadly weaponry the world has ever seen. The ideal shape for a gravity-defying vehicle happens to be a perfect disk, making antigravity tests a possible explanation for the numerous UFO sightings of the past 50 years.<br><br>Chronicling the origins of antigravity research in the world's most advanced research facility, which was operated by the Third Reich during World War II, <i>The Hunt for Zero Point</i> traces U.S. involvement in the project, beginning with the recruitment of former Nazi scientists after the war.

The last group figures, Cook explains, because the ideal craft for "electrogravitic reaction" would take the form of a disc, a design consideration seen in the shape of current stealth aircraft. It could just be, the author suggests, that what witnesses have taken to be flying saucers might instead be antigravity-aircraft prototypes, though he cautions that "the subject is too complex ... to conform to a single explanation."</p><p> And therein hangs a good part of this always interesting, if admittedly speculative, story, which, regardless of the truth of the matter (or, perhaps, antimatter), will appeal to techies and Trekkies alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>&#x201c;An intriguing work of scientific speculation.

His best works include Green Lantern/Green Arrow and Batman with Neal Adams, The Shadow with Mike Kaluta and The Question with Denys Cowan, all of which were hailed for sophisticated stories that expanded the artistic potential of the mainstream portion of the medium. As an editor, he is principally known for editing Batman. His 1970s run on Batman is perhaps his most well known endeavour, turning Batman from the campiness of the 1960s TV show, to &#34;The Batman&#34;, getting back to the character&#39;s darker roots and emphasizing his detective skills. This grimer and more sophisticated Dark Knight, as well as new villians such as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, brought back Batman from the verge of pop culture oblivion. His work would influence later incarnations of Batman, from the seminal comic &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&#34; by Frank Miller, to the movie Batman Begins in 2005.These frequently reprinted Green Lantern/Green Arrow stories from the early &#x2018;70s are both a harbinger of things to come in American comics and a dead end. As sales for DC&#x2019;s Green Lantern fell, young writer O&#x2019;Neil, influenced by &#x2018;60s liberal politics, decided to have superheroes confront real social issues of the time, including racism, political corruption and capitalistic exploitation of workers. O&#x2019;Neil compared Green Lantern to a policeman, accustomed to unquestioningly accepting the status quo. Green Lantern is clued into social ills by the newly radicalized superhero archer Green Arrow, whom O&#x2019;Neil revamped into a contemporary Robin Hood. O&#x2019;Neil thus started a trend of "relevant" comics that quickly faded. Nor have these stories aged well. Influenced by magazine illustrators, Adams&#x2019;s art was acclaimed at the time for its realism, but now seems to glamorize naturalistic subjects. Though professing to portray moral complexities, these stories make their "real life" malefactors as purely evil as standard costumed villains. O&#x2019;Neil vividly characterizes his two heroes, but they still lack true depth. The writer is more successful with characterization in Volume 2, and his introductions to Volume 1 provide proof of the sophisticated author he has become. Readers interested in comics history will want to read this collection; it represents an early step toward the medium&#x2019;s maturity.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He tells his story straight and with dry wit.</p><p>American Presidents make decisions on war unaware that the human source intelligence provided by the CIA is often false or nonexistent. From Harry Truman during the Korean War to George Bush during the War on Terror, modern Presidents have faced their darkest moments as a result of poor intelligence. The CIA has assured Congress and the President that intelligence programs in hostile areas of the world are thriving, when they simply do not exist. The CIA is a broken, Soviet-style bureaucracy with its own agenda: to consume federal funds, to expand within the United States, to feign activity, and to enrich current and former employees. After 9/11, billions of dollars directed by Congress to increase the number of officers working under deep cover on foreign streets have disappeared without the CIA fielding a single additional, productive officer overseas.<p><i>The Human Factor</i> makes the case for intelligence reform, showing the career of an accomplished deep cover CIA case officer who struggled not with finding human sources of secret information in rogue nations, but with the CIA's bloated, dysfunctional, even cancerous bureaucracy. After initial training in the US, Ishmael Jones spent his career in multiple, consecutive overseas assignments, as a deep cover officer without benefit of diplomatic immunity. In dingy hotel rooms, Jones met alone with weapons scientists, money launderers, and terrorists. He pushed intelligence missions forward while escaping purges within the Agency, active thwarting of operations by bureaucrats, and the ever-present threat of arrest by hostile foreign intelligence services. Jones became convinced that the CIA's failure to fulfill its purpose endangers Americans. Attempting reform from within proved absurd. Jones resigned from the CIA to make a public case for reform through the writing of this book.</p><p>Effective American organizations feature clear missions, streamlined management, transparency, and accountability. The CIA has none of these. While it has always hired good people, it wastes and even perverts employees. The CIA is not doing its job and must be fixed. Until it is, our lives and the lives of our allies are in jeopardy.</p>Ishmael Jones was born in the United States and raised in the Middle East, East Asia, and East Africa. He attended universities in the US and served as an officer in the US Marine Corps. In the late 1980s he joined the Central Intelligence Agency, where he served as a deep cover officer focusing on human sources with access to intelligence on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. His assignments included more than fifteen years of continuous overseas service in numerous exotic countries and several rogue nations. He resigned from the CIA in good standing. Ishmael Jones is a pseudonym, in accordance with laws that make it a felony to reveal the true names of deep cover officers.</p><h2>Death of a River Guide</h2><p>Aljaz Cosini, river guide, is leading a group of tourists on a raft down Tasmania's wild Franklin River when his greatest fear is realized - a tourist falls into the river and may drown. An ordinary man with many regrets, Aljaz rises to an uncharacteristic heroism and offers his own life in trade.<br>Aljaz becomes trapped under rapids and waits in the hope of being rescued, his mind flooded with visions both horrible and fabulous, reliving the history of his own life and those of his forbears. He sees Couta Ho, the beautiful, spirited woman he loved, and he sees how that love was broken by tragic loss. He sees his pipe-smoking Auntie Ellie pursued by cows she thinks are evil spirits. As cities grow from the wild rain forest he witnesses Ellie's husband, Reg, having his teeth pulled and sold to pay for a ripple-iron house.<br>As towns turn blue, as whales fly over mountains, and as a tree bursts into flamboyant flower every midwinter at his grandfather's forest grave, Aljaz discovers himself traveling down a river, but it is no river he recognizes. It leads him to a world where dreaming reasserts its power over thinking, where his family tree branches into stories that are Aboriginal, Celtic, Italian, Irish, Chinese, Slovene - stories that ground him in the land. As the river rises and his visions grow more turbulent, Aljaz discovers within them the soul history of his country.<br>Death of a River Guide is the story of one man who discovers that there is nothing in his extraordinary universe to which he is unconnected: plants and animals as well as men and women, small things as well as large. It is a book about family and place, and the roots that pull us back to our origins. Earthy, magical, comic, and tragic by turns, it is a novel that celebrates life and confirms Richard Flanagan as one of the world's most exciting new voices.</p><p>In this brilliant, labyrinthine second novel, a drowning man named Aljaz Cosini is granted visions of his family history stretching into the distant past--even as he revisits his final days along the remote and treacherous Franklin River. Richard Flanagan's protagonist has been away from Tasmania for the last decade. Sick, lonely, and financially strapped, he returns to his hometown and soon runs into an old colleague known as Pig's Breath, who offers him a low-paying stint as a river guide: <blockquote> I can see that Pig's Breath knows Aljaz well enough to see that Aljaz desperately wants to visit the Franklin River country, that there is a need in him, which Pig's Breath does not have, to go back there, and that this is his only way of doing it. And while Aljaz sits there trying to look as if he is chewing over numbers, Pig's Breath can tell that what he is in fact doing is smelling the river, hearing it run, watching the rain mists rise from its valleys, drinking its tea-coloured waters from his cupped hands. </blockquote> Flanagan (<i>The Sound of One Hand Clapping</i>) has been compared to Faulkner for his loving attention to place, but his narrative talents are more akin to those of G�nter Grass. There are echoes of <i>The Tin Drum</i> in the picaresque tale of Aljaz's emergence from the womb, wrapped in the caul that suggests second sight. Throughout, a series of similarly magical occurrences lends sparkle, if little illumination, to these hardscrabble lives in the Tasmanian wilderness. All of which goes to explain why <i>Death of a River Guide</i> is an unusually rich novel, and one of Australia's most distinguished literary exports in recent years. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Richard Flanagan is the author of three novels which have all been published to international acclaim: Death of a River Guide, The Sound of One Hand Clapping and Gould&#39;s Book of Fish.

Understanding the monetary system, the nuances of home mortgages, and instruments of financial leverage at all stages of the market are essential for all real estate professionals. This book is designed to offer comprehensive instruction in real estate finance, while also satisfying California state licensing requirements.</p><p></p><h2>The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom</h2><p>Managing money is far more than a matter of balancing our checkbooks or picking investments?witness the fact that many of us know what we ought to be doing with our money yet often just don't do it. This is the first personal finance book that gives us not only the knowledge of how to han-dle money, but also the power to break through the barriers that hold us back.<br><br>Suze Orman, best-selling author of <i>You've Earned It, Don 't Lose it,</i> goes beyond the nuts and bolts of managing money to explore the psychological, even spiritual, power money has in our lives. Before we can get control of our finances, we must get control of our attitudes about money, feelings that were shaped by our earliest experiences with it. Letting go of these anxieties and creating new attitudes are the first steps of Suze Orman's program.<br><br>Next comes mastering the practical elements of financial life: investments, credit, insurance, and estate and retirement planning. This book tells you everything you need to know to provide for your-self and your family?not abstract principles but specific, concrete, and easy-to-follow procedures. Here you will also find the latest tax code revisions regarding estate taxes, inheritance, and individual retirement allowances (IRAs), including vital information on the new Roth IRA and educational IRAs and how to make them work best for you. You'll also learn why you should trust your own instincts more than someone else's advice in making any financial decision.<br><br>Finally come the most unusual -- and powerful -- steps: understanding the spiritual side of money. As Suze Orman explains, financial freedom is about realizing that we are worth far more than our money. Her program concludes by showing how to leave behind financial anxieties and open ourselves to true abundance?not only of the pocketbook but also of the heart.</p><p>When Suze Orman was 13 she watched her father dive into the flames of his burning take-out chicken shack in order to rescue his cash register. In that moment Orman learned that money was more important than life itself. And so it became her quest to be rich. But years later, when Orman became a wealthy broker with a huge investment firm, she was profoundly unhappy. What went wrong? She had not yet achieved financial freedom. In her nine-step program, Orman covers the ingredients to financial success--confronting our beliefs and fears, learning the nuts and bolts (and insiders secrets!) of savvy management, and finding the spiritual trust that leads to abundance.Suze Orman is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, <b>The Courage to Be Rich</b> and <b>The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom</b>, and the national bestseller <b>You've Earned It, Don't Lose It</b>.

Continuing this tradition, Sisters of Tomorrow: The First Women of Science Fiction offers readers a comprehensive selection of works by genre luminaries, including author C. L. Moore, artist Margaret Brundage, and others who were well known in their day, including poet Julia Boynton Green, science journalist L. Taylor Hansen, and editor Mary Gnaedinger. Providing insightful commentary and context, this anthology documents how women in the early twentieth century contributed to the pulp-magazine community and showcases the content they produced, including short stories, editorial work, illustrations, poetry, and science journalism. Yaszek and Sharp&#39;s critical annotation and author biographies link women&#39;s work in the early science fiction community to larger patterns of feminine literary and cultural production in turn-of-the-twentieth-century America. In a concluding essay, the award-winning author Kathleen Ann Goonan considers such work in relation to the history of women in science and engineering and to the contemporary science fiction community itself.</p><p>LISA YASZEK is a professor and associate chair in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech.

Over the centuries, each such map has become yet another precious link not only in the history of the state, but also in the ever-evolving &#x201c;Virginia&#x201d; as imagined by its residents and, more broadly, by the rest of America. <i>Virginia: Mapping the Old Dominion State through History</i> provides a fascinating journey into the past of the Old Dominion State through gloriously detailed maps from the Library of Congress. Edited and with a foreword by renowned photo editor and author Vincent Virga, it also includes compelling historical essays by writer and Virginia native Emilee Hines.

Days later, with many bodies still unidentifiable, Karen resigns herself to the awful truth: her husband of eighteen years is dead.</p><p>On that same day, a suspicious hit-and-run accident leaves a young man dead in Karen's hometown of Greenwich, Connecticut. Ty Hauck, a detective, becomes emotionally caught up in the case and finds a clue that shockingly connects the two seemingly unrelated events.</p><p>Months later, two men show up at Karen's home digging into Charles's business dealings. Hundreds of millions of dollars are missing&#x2014;and the trail points squarely to Charles. With doubt suddenly cast on everything she has ever known, Karen, with Hauck, steps into a widening storm of hedge fund losses, international scams, and murder. And as the investigations converge, these two strangers touched by tragedy are pulled into a deepening relationship and unwittingly open the door to a twisted&#x2014;and deadly&#x2014;conspiracy.</p><p>With its breakneck pacing, plentiful twists, compelling characters, and abundant heart, <em>The Dark Tide</em> confirms Andrew Gross's place as a master storyteller at the top of his game.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Gross is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> and international bestsellers <em>Everything to Lose</em>, <em>No Way Back</em>, <em>15 Seconds</em>, <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>, <em>Reckless</em>, <em>Don't Look Back</em>, <em>The Dark Tide</em>, and <em>The Blue Zone</em>. He is also coauthor of five number one bestsellers with James Patterson, including <em>Judge &amp; Jury</em> and <em>Lifeguard</em>. His books have been translated into more than twenty-five languages.</p>THE DARK TIDE is one of those books for which a tidy resolution seems impossible, but the author knocks it out of the park. Charles Friedman was up to something underhanded in his Wall Street dealings, but it looks like his secret died with him when terrorists bombed the train he was on. However, for his wife, the problems are just beginning. Melissa Leo is so adept at pulling the listener through the myriad twists and turns of this novel that they'll find their hearts racing. Her interpretations of the many male characters are just as good as her portrayal of the heroine. Leo makes it easy to get lost in a good book.

Sought help in vain.<br><br><b>A Night To Remember</b><br><br>From the first distress flares to the struggles of those left adrift for hours in freezing waters, here is the legendary disaster relived by the few who survived and can never forget the many who did not.</p><p>James Cameron's 1997 <i>Titanic</i> movie is a smash hit, but Walter Lord's 1955 classic remains in some ways unsurpassed. Lord interviewed scores of <i>Titanic</i> passengers, fashioning a gripping you-are-there account of the ship's sinking that you can read in half the time it takes to see the film. The book boasts many perfect movie moments not found in Cameron's film. When the ship hits the berg, passengers see "tiny splinters of ice in the air, fine as dust, that give off myriads of bright colors whenever caught in the glow of the deck lights." Survivors saw dawn reflected off other icebergs in a rainbow of shades, depending on their angle toward the sun: pink, mauve, white, deep blue--a landscape so eerie, a little boy tells his mom, "Oh, Muddie, look at the beautiful North Pole with no Santa Claus on it." <p> A <i>Titanic</i> funnel falls, almost hitting a lifeboat--and consequently washing it 30 yards away from the wreck, saving all lives aboard. One man calmly rides the vertical boat down as it sinks, steps into the sea, and doesn't even get his head wet while waiting to be successfully rescued. On one side of the boat, almost no males are permitted in the lifeboats; on the other, even a male Pekingese dog gets a seat. Lord includes a crucial, tragically ironic drama Cameron couldn't fit into the film: the failure of the nearby ship <i>Californian</i> to save all those aboard the sinking vessel because distress lights were misread as random flickering and the telegraph was an early wind-up model that no one wound. </p><p> Lord's account is also smarter about the horrifying class structure of the disaster, which Cameron reduces to hollow Hollywood formula. No children died in the First and Second Class decks; 53 out of 76 children in steerage died. According to the press, which regarded the lower-class passengers as a small loss to society, "The night was a magnificent confirmation of women and children first, yet somehow the loss rate was higher for Third Class children than First Class men." As the ship sank, writes Lord, "the poop deck, normally Third Class space ... was suddenly becoming attractive to all kinds of people." Lord's logic is as cold as the Atlantic, and his bitter wit is quite dry.</p>"Devotion, gallantry...Benjamin Guggenheim changing to evening clothes to meet death; Mrs. Isador Straus clinging to her husband, refusing to get in a lifeboat; Arthur Ryerson giving his life belt to his wife's maid...It is a book to remember."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Kris Longknife: Intrepid</h2><p>Kris Longknife has been assigned to The Wasp, the best warship beyond the Rim of Human Space.

Even more remarkable, she wrote them during one of the coldest, snowiest winters (1962-63) Londoners have ever known. Snowbound, without central heating, she and her two children spent much of their time sniffling, coughing, or running temperatures (In "Fever 103�" she writes, "I have been flickering, off, on, off on. / The sheets grow heavy as a lecher's kiss."). Pipes froze, lights failed, and candles were unobtainable. <p> As if these physical privations weren't enough, Plath was out in the cold in another sense--her husband, Ted Hughes, had left her for another woman earlier that year. Despite all this (or perhaps <i>because</i> of it), the <i>Ariel</i> poems dazzle with their lyricism, their surprising and vivid imagery, and their wit. Rather than confining herself to her bleak surroundings, Plath draws from a wide array of experience. In "Berck-Plage," for instance, clouds are "electrifyingly-coloured sherbets, scooped from the freeze." In "The Night Dances," the poet stands crib-side, reveling in her son's own brand of do-si-do: "Such pure leaps and spirals--Surely they travel / The world forever, I shall not entirely / Sit emptied of beauties, the gift / Of your small breath..." </p><p> Though at times they present the reader with hopelessness laid bare, these poems also teem with the brightest shards of a life, confounding those who merely look for the words of a gloomy, dispassionate suicide. Plath rose each morning in the final months of her life to "that still blue, almost eternal hour before the baby's cry" and left us these words like "axes/After whose stroke the wood rings..."</p>Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and studied at Smith College.

"Full of emotional truth and the beauty of immediate, trusting speech, overbrimming with folklore of great imaginative richness."&#x2015;Seamus Heaney. Edited with an Introduction by Brian Friel.</p><p>Charles McGlinchey (1861-1954) was a weaver by trade, and lived his entire life on the Inishowen peninsula in the northwest of Ireland. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, McGlinchey dictated his personal memories of life and Irish history to a local schoolmaster, and these eventually formed his memoirs entitled <i>The Last of the Name</i>.When Charles McGlinchey (1861-1954) was in his eighties, local school teacher Patrick Kavanaugh decided to record the stories McGlinchey told him during their biweekly visits. McGlinchey, a weaver living in a small parish in County Donegal, Ireland, had never married and had outlived all his family (thus the book's title). Fascinated by the parish's local history and lore, Kavanaugh recorded McGlinchey's autobiography in his own repetitive colloquial speech, mixing English and Irish with occasional bog Latin. Thirty years later, the manuscript found its way to Brian Friel, who gave the oral history its present form. Originally published in Belfast in 1986, this book reads like a collaboration between Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes) and Mitch Albom (Tuesdays with Morrie). Evoking herbal remedies while ignoring the world wars, this evocation of a simpler time is recommended for libraries with Irish literature and genealogy collections.APam Kingsbury, Florence, AL <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Penny Whistle</h2><p>In the late 1800s, in a small coal mining town, a teacher, Jonathan Stuart, and two girls, Maggie MacAuley and Summer Rankin, lead an entire town on a lesson about God and the gift of hope.

Living half-wild on an African farm with her horse, her monkey, and her best friend, every day is beautiful.

She grew up in Zimbabwe, Brussels, and London, and is currently a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. She begins each day with a cartwheel and believes that reading is almost exactly the same as cartwheeling: it turns the world upside down and leaves you breathless. In her spare time, she enjoys walking on tightropes and trespassing on the rooftops of Oxford colleges.Cartwheeling in Thunderstorms <br><br> <br>WILHELMINA KNEW THAT THERE WERE some houses that had glass in every window and locks on the doors.<br> <br>The farmhouse in which she lived was not one of them. If there was a key to the front door, Wilhelmina had never seen it. It was likely that the goats that wandered in and out of the kitchen had eaten it. The house was at the end of the longest of the farm roads in the hottest corner of Zimbabwe. Her bedroom window was a square space in the wall. During the rains, she sewed plastic bags to make a screen and stretched it across the frame. During the heat, the dust blew in.<br> <br>Years ago, a visitor to the farm had asked Will about her window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Surely your father can afford a pane of glass?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like to be dusty,&#x201d; she had said, &#x201c;and wet.&#x201d; Dust and rain made mud. Mud was full of possibilities.<br> <br>The farm roads were bald and red with the settled dust. They were walked daily by Captain Browne, owner of the farm, driven daily by William Silver, foreman of the farm, and ridden daily by Wilhelmina, William&#x2019;s only child.<br> <br>Wilhelmina rode better than any boy on the farm, because her father had known that to ride before you can walk is like drinking from glass bottles of Coke underwater, or hanging by the knees from baobab trees: disorienting and delicious. So Wilhelmina grew up running under horses&#x2019; bellies and tripping up into horse manure and tugging handfuls of her long dark hair when horseflies stung. The horseboys living in the tin-roofed cottages in the staff quarters never wept at horseflies&#x2014;sometimes they swore in a leisurely, laughing way in Shona&#x2014;&#x201c;Ach, booraguma&#x201d;&#x2014;and Wilhelmina was sure that she was the equal of any boy. She was faster than most of the boys her age on foot, too. And she was many other things: When the men on the farm talked about her in the evenings, they needed handfuls of &#x201c;ands&#x201d; to describe her: Will was stubborn, sha, and exasperating and wild and honest and true.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>In the morning light of late October, Will was crouched on the floor stirring a pot of methylated spirit and water. Meths, applied to the feet, hardened the soles and made living shoes. There were six assorted chairs in the airy sitting room, but Will liked the floor. There was more space. Will had widely spaced eyes, and widely spaced toes, and was altogether a favorite of space. Her talk was spaced too, she knew&#x2014;the slow talk of the African afternoon, with good gaps of silence.<br> <br>Will heard the clatter of hooves and a hungry whinnying. That meant William Silver was home from his early-morning gallop over the farm. Everyone in that part of Zimbabwe rose early. The main part of the day&#x2019;s work had to be done by lunch, and October was the hottest month. The heat melted the roads into tarred soup; birds got stuck in it.<br> <br>The sitting room door opened, and a hairy face peered round it. Will felt the door open before she saw it; it was joy. Dad was back; she jumped up in one single movement, all speed and legs, and hurled herself into his arms, wrapping her feet around his waist. &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning! Morning, Wildcat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Will buried her face in her father&#x2019;s neck. &#x201c;Morning, Dad,&#x201d; she said, her voice muffled. With most men, Will was tense-muscled. They left her half-marveling and half-wary, and she made sure to keep her few steps of distance. She hated having to shake hands with the unknown skin of strangers; but Dad, with his muscled softness, was different.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I thought you were gone for the day, hey?&#x201d; said William.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ja. Ja, soon. But I wanted to see your face first, Dad. I missed you.&#x201d; Will had been out at the tree house last night, asleep in the largeness of the night air by the time her father had gotten home. They could go for days without seeing each other, but she thought it made the happiness, when they did, sharper&#x2014;more tangy. &#x201c;But now&#x201d;&#x2014;she scrambled up&#x2014;&#x201c;I can go, ja. I haven&#x2019;t fed Shumba, and Simon&#x2019;ll be waiting.&#x201d; She turned at the door, wanting to say something that would mean &#x201c;I love you. Goodness how I do love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Faranuka, Dad!&#x201d; Faranuka. Will&#x2019;s Shona was good, and &#x201c;Faranuka&#x201d; was Shona for &#x201c;Be happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Simon was waiting. Simon was Will&#x2019;s best friend. He was everything that she wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;a tall, fluid black boy to her waiflike, angular white girl. It had not been love at first sight. When Simon had arrived to train as a farmhand, Will had taken one single look and with six-year-old certainty announced that, no, she did not like him. He was flimsy. That was because Simon had enormous bush-baby eyes, tender trusting pools that seemed to hold tears just ready to fall from beneath stupidly curled lashes.<br> <br>But it hadn&#x2019;t taken long for Will to see that Simon was breathing, leaping, brilliant proof that appearances are deceptive. In fact, she knew now, Si was a stretched-catapult of a boy, the scourge of the stables, with a hoarse laugh much too deep for him, and arms and legs that jerked and broke any passing cup or plate. His dislike of the tin bathtub, and his reveling in the softly squelching Zimbabwean mud, meant that Simon had a distinctive smell. He smelled to the young Will of dust and sap and salt beef.<br> <br>Will had smelled to Simon of earth and sap and mint.<br> <br>So with such essential aspects in common&#x2014;the sap, most obviously, but also the large eyes and the haphazard limbs&#x2014;it was inevitable that the two fell in sort-of-love by the time they were seven, and by the time their ages were in double digits, they were friends of the firmest, stickiest, and eternal sort.<br> <br>Simon was the one who had taught Will how to bring her horse to a gallop on the home stretch to the stables, yelling &#x201c;Yah! Ee-yah! Come on, slowcoach!&#x201d; And he taught her how to swing herself round to the underside of the horse&#x2019;s neck and ride upside down so that her long hair was coated with the flying dust, and her cheeks slipped into her eyes.<br> <br>They swapped languages. He learned her Zimbabwean-twanged English and she&#x2014;with tongue-poked-out concentration&#x2014;the basics of his Chikorekore Shona. She showed him how to swim underwater for minutes at a time. The trick was to breathe in slowly beforehand&#x2014;not a gulp, but patiently and through pursed lips, like sucking through a straw. Her feet became dark brown and hardened from years of barefoot races across the fields, and her nails were filthy.<br> <br>Since last December, Simon had lived with his brother Tedias in the staff quarters, a block of brick huts and fires on the edge of ?Two Tree Hill Farm. The name, Captain Browne had said, rolling one of his cigarettes in tobacco-green fingers, was a kind of bad joke, because there were several hundred trees on Two Tree Hill, enough to obliterate the hill itself. In fact, he said, it would have been better named Just Tree Farm. Or Tree Tree Tree Tree Tree Farm. Ha-ha, Captain Browne.<br> <br>But of course there were clear patches, made of brown grass and shimmering heat and anthills, and it was across one of these that Will now ran, kicking the backs of her feet against her bottom and singing. As soon as she was within shouting distance of Simon&#x2019;s mudbricked home, Will gave her best Shona call.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ee-weh!&#x201d; Shouting distance on that farm was at least a field-length farther than anywhere else, because the air was still and there were no cars except for the truck; a little noise went a gloriously long way. &#x201c;Simon! Simon! You in, Si?&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Simon picked his nose in a pointed sort of way. He was squatting outside the hut just within the shade of the brown thatch roof, drinking Coke from a glass bottle. Tedias nudged Simon with his toe. He spoke in Shona, &#x201c;Uchaenda. Up, boy. Off with you to the little madam.&#x201d;<br> <br>The &#x201c;little madam&#x201d; was an old joke. The shrill and imperious &#x201c;madam&#x201d; of the typical farmer&#x2019;s wife couldn&#x2019;t be further from Will&#x2019;s brown and gold manners.<br> <br>Simon threw an aggrieved pebble at Will&#x2019;s feet. &#x201c;Will!&#x201d; He scowled. &#x201c;Where you been? I thought you weren&#x2019;t coming. You such a slowcoach, man.&#x201d; She wasn&#x2019;t, but he said it anyway. &#x201c;Like a caterpillar with no legs. Was going to go off without you just now, madman.&#x201d; &#x201c;Madman&#x201d; was Simon&#x2019;s variation on &#x201c;madam.&#x201d; They both thought it was closer to the truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry. Sorry, Si, truly. Sorry-sorry.&#x201d; Will didn&#x2019;t give explanations.<br> <br>She stared up at Tedias, whom Will loved achingly. He was a hero, big and scarred and restfully silent. She had to squint because the sun was strong now, beating in the edgeless blue of the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mangwanani, Tedias.&#x201d; She bobbed the curtsy she gave to the captain&#x2019;s visitors. &#x201c;Mangwanani&#x201d; meant &#x201c;good morning.&#x201d; Her Simon did not need to be saluted, but Tedias, in his slow largeness, his bare chest, and his kindness to the dogs, deserved respect.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mangwanani, Will.&#x201d; He pronounced her name like all the men on the farm, &#x201c;wheel,&#x201d; and her father had picked it up, called her Buck and Wheel, Cartwheel, Catherine Wheel. &#x201c;Marara sei, Wheel? Did you sleep?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a formal answer to that, but Will, to her annoyance, found she&#x2019;d forgotten it. There were codes in Shona she hadn&#x2019;t yet learned, and she quivered now; there was so much to know, there were subtleties that hung out of sight, things that she knew she didn&#x2019;t know she didn&#x2019;t know. She said, &#x201c;Ndarara . . . ah . . . Ndarara kana mararawo.&#x201d; I slept well if you slept well.<br> <br>Tedias nodded with what seemed to be approval. (Though, you couldn&#x2019;t be sure with other people, Will thought, staring up at his slow, heavy smile. That was a central rule to life, the one thing you could be sure of.) &#x201c;Ndarara, Will, yes,&#x201d; said Tedias. &#x201c;I slept.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon, Will could see, was growing tired of the formalities. He finished his Coke, burped, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and threw down the bottle. He kicked it along the path. &#x201c;Come on, Will. Madman mad-cat Will.&#x201d; He hopped backward, so that each hop landed on &#x201c;on.&#x201d; &#x201c;Come on, come on, come on, girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Will stayed in the sun, trying not to smile. Because Will didn&#x2019;t take orders from anyone. She crouched down, making her most aggravating proud-face, and began scratching a W in the dirt with a long stick. A beetle lumbered up it and onto her arm, and she stilled herself, enjoying the tickling feeling of its thread-thin feet. It was deep green with shimmers of blue and turquoise, with pitch-black legs. She kissed it very softly. If happiness were a color, it would be the color of this beetle, thought Will.<br> <br>There was a whistle. Will grinned. Simon&#x2019;s whistles were so perfect that they could speak whole archways of emotion: shock, happiness, hot admiration, look out! This one said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting.&#x201d; With maybe a hint of, &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d; They were planning a quick raid on the mango tree and a picnic by the rock pool. She should go, she knew.<br> <br>But it was hard for Will Silver to keep firm hands on herself, because small things&#x2014;dragonflies, earwigs, sticks with peeling bark, warm rain, those wonderful curls of fur behind the dogs&#x2019; ears&#x2014;they had a strange way of making time disappear. She had wondered, often, if other people felt the same way, but had never been able to explain it properly, that feeling of sharpness and fullness.<br> <br>Simon whistled again. He meant it this time, Will could tell. She jumped up to standing, whipped up an imaginary horse&#x2014;whooping her throaty, &#x201c;Yagh! Yah!&#x201d;&#x2014;and tore past him. Will was fast, and proud of it. She ran tilting forward, tanned skin stark against the white-blue of the sky and the yellow-green of the grass. &#x201c;Race you, Si!&#x201d; she called, but she didn&#x2019;t say where to.<br> <br>Simon hurtled after her. She was uncatchable in this mood, like a bushfire, infectious and exasperating at once. She might run for miles and miles and miles.<br> <br>As he threw his long legs after her, he cried, &#x201c;Look at the little madman! Look at that dirt! Ach, pity our poor foreman&#x2014;his little girl&#x2019;s gone wild!&#x201d;</p><h2>Table for Five</h2><p>Sometimes it takes a leap of faith in order to soar . . .<br><br>A gifted teacher, Lily Robinson adores her students, but fiercely guards her independent lifestyle.

Lily Robinson put a hand on the boy's shoulder to keep him from bouncing off the covered sidewalk and into the driving rain.<br><br>"Aw, come on, it's easy. You just say the name of your street and&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, thank you, Russell," Lily said in her "enough's enough" tone. She hoped he didn't really know what a porn star was. "That's inappropriate, and you're supposed to be line leader this afternoon."<br><br>"Oops." Reminded of the privilege, Russell stiffened his spine and marched in a straight line, dutifully leading twenty-three third-graders to the area under the awning by the parking lot. "I'm going to Echo Ridge today," he said, heading for Bus Number Four. "I have a golf lesson."<br><br>"In this rain?"<br><br>"It'll clear up, I bet. See you, Miss Robinson." Russell went bounding toward the bus, hopscotching around puddles in the parking lot.<br><br>Lily doled out goodbyes and have-a-good-days to the rest of her students, watching them scatter like a flock of startled ducklings to buses and carpools. Charlie Hol-loway and her best friend, Lindsey Davenport, were last in line, holding hands and chattering together while they waited for Mrs. Davenport's car to pull forward.<br><br>When Charlie caught Lily's eye, she ducked her head and looked away. Lily felt a beat of sympathy for the little girl, who was painfully aware that her parents were coming in for a conference after school. The child looked small and fragile, trying to disappear into her yellow rain slicker. Lily wanted to reassure her, to tell her not to worry.<br><br>Charlie didn't give her a chance. "There's your mom," she said, giving Lindsey's hand a tug. "'Bye, have a good weekend," she called to Lily, and the girls dashed for the blue Volvo station wagon.<br><br>Lily smiled and waved, making an effort not to appear troubled, but seeing them like that, best friends skipping off together, reminded her of her own childhood best friend&#x2014;Charlie's mother, Crystal. This was not going to be an easy conference.<br><br>"Hey, what's the matter?" asked Greg Duncan, the PE teacher. After school, he coached the high-school golf team, though he was known to be a full-time flirt.<br><br>"You're not supposed to notice that anything's the matter," Lily told him.<br><br>He grinned and loped to her side, a big, friendly Saint Bernard of a guy, all velvet brown eyes, giant paws, a silver whistle on a lanyard around his neck. "I know exactly what's wrong," he said. "You don't have a date tonight."<br><br>Here we go again, thought Lily. She liked Greg a lot, she really did, but he exhausted her with his need for attention. He was too much guy, the way a Saint Bernard is too much dog. Twice divorced, he had dated most of the women she knew and had recently set his sights on her. "Wrong," she said, grinning back. "I've got plans."<br><br>"Liar. You're just trying to spare my feelings."<br><br>Guilty as charged, Lily thought.<br><br>"Is he hitting on you again?" Edna Klein, the school principal, joined them under the awning. In her sixties, with waist-length silver hair and intense blue eyes, Edna resembled a Woodstock grandmother. She wore Birken-stocks with socks and turquoise-and-silver jewelry, and she lived at a commune called Cloud Mountain. Yet no one failed to take her seriously. Along with her earth-mother looks, she possessed a Ph.D. from Berkeley, three ex-husbands, four grown children and ten years of sobriety in AA. When it came to running a school, she was a consummate professional, supportive of teachers, encouraging to students, inspiring confidence in parents.<br><br>"Harassment in the workplace," Lily stated. "I'm thinking of filing a complaint."<br><br>"I'm the one with the complaint," Greg said. "I've been hitting on this woman since Valentine's Day, and all I get from her is a movie once a month."<br><br>"At least I let you pick the movie. <em>Hell on Earth</em> was a real high point for me."<br><br>"You're a heartless wench, Lily Robinson," he said, heading for the gym. "Have a nice weekend, ladies."<br><br>"He's barking up the wrong tree," Lily said to Edna.<br><br>"Are you this negative about all men or just Coach Duncan?"<br><br>Lily laughed. "What is it about turning thirty? Suddenly my love life is everyone's business."<br><br>"Of course it is, hon. Because we all want you to have one."<br><br>People were always asking Lily if she was seeing anyone special or if she intended to have children. Everyone seemed to want to know when she was going to settle down. They didn't understand. She <em>was</em> settled. Her life was exactly the way she wanted it. Relationships were scary things to Lily. Getting into an emotional relationship was like getting into a car with a drunk driver. You were in for a wild ride, and it was bound to end with someone getting hurt.<br><br>"I'm meddling, aren't I?" Edna admitted.<br><br>"Definitely."<br><br>"I can't help myself. I'd love to see you with someone special, Lily."<br><br>Lily took off her glasses and polished the lenses on a corner of her sweater. The world turned to a smear of rain-soaked gray and green, the principal palette of an Oregon spring. "Why won't anyone believe that I'm satisfied with things just the way they are?"<br><br>"Satisfaction and happiness are two different matters."<br><br>Lily put her glasses on and the world came back into focus. "Feeling satisfied makes me happy."<br><br>"One of these days, my friend, you'll find yourself wanting more," said Edna.<br><br>"Not today," Lily said, thinking of the upcoming conference.<br><br>A group of students clustered around to tell her goodbye. Edna took the time to speak to each child personally, and each turned away with a big smile on his or her face.<br><br>Lily felt a small nudge of discontent. <em>Satisfaction and happiness are two different matters.</em> It was hard enough to make herself happy, let alone another person, she thought. Yet when she looked around, she had to admit that she saw people do it every day. A mother coaxed laughter from her baby, a man brought flowers to his wife, a child opened a school lunch box to find a love note from home.<br><br>But the happiness never lasted. Lily knew that.<br><br>She lingered for a few minutes more while the children were set free for the weekend. They ran to their mothers, getting hugs, showing off papers or artwork, their happy chatter earning fond smiles. Watching them, Lily felt like a tourist observing a different culture. These people weren't like her. They knew what it was like to be connected. By contrast, Lily felt curiously distant and unencumbered, so light she could float away.<br><br>While waiting for the Holloways to arrive, Lily checked the conference table, low and round and gleaming, surrounded by pint-size chairs.<br><br>The desks were aligned in neat rows, the chairs put up so the night crew could vacuum. The smells of chalk dust, cleaning fluid and the dry aroma of oft-used books mingled with the ineffable burnt-sugar smell of small children.<br><br>She set out two things on the table&#x2014;a manila folder, thick with samples of Charlie's work, and the requisite box of tissues, Puffs with lotion, which Lily bought by the case at Costco. A roomful of eight- and nine-year-olds tended to go through them fast.<br><br>She moved along the bank of windows, adjusting the shades so they were all even at half mast. The glass panes were decorated with the children's cutout ducks in galoshes, each bearing the day's penmanship practice: "April showers bring May flowers." Outside, a jagged bolt of lightning raked across the sky, punctuating the old adage.<br><br>With a grimace, she turned to the calendar display on the bulletin board and silently counted down the column of Fridays. Nine weeks left until the end of school. Nine weeks to go, and then it would be sunshine and blue skies and the trip she'd been planning for months. Going to Europe had always seemed such a lofty, barely reasonable goal for a schoolteacher in a small Oregon town, but maybe that was what made it so appealing. Each year, Lily saved her money and headed off to a new land, and this would be her most ambitious trip yet.<br><br>She tugged her mind away from thoughts of summer and concentrated instead on preparing for a difficult meeting. She inspected the classroom as she always did before conferences. Lily believed it was important for people to see that their children spent the day in a neat, organized, attractive environment.<br><br>At the center of the front of the room was a dark slate blackboard. She'd been offered a whiteboard but declined. She preferred the crisp, controlled quality of her Palmer-method script on the smooth, timeless surface. She liked the coolness of the slate against her hand when she touched it, and the way her fingertips left a moist impression, before evaporating into nothingness. The sound of chalk on an old-fashioned blackboard always reminded her of the one place she had always felt safe as a child&#x2014;in a schoolroom.<br><br>This was her world, the place she best belonged. She couldn't imagine another life for herself.<br><br>Glancing at the clock, she went to the door and opened it. Her nameplate read "Ms. Robinson&#x2014;Room 105" and was surrounded by each child's name, neatly printed with a photo on a yellow tagboard star.<br><br>Lily adored children&#x2014;other people's children. For one special year of their lives, they were hers to care for and nurture, and she put all of her heart into it. Thanks to her job, she was able to tell people she did have children, twenty-four of them. And in the fall, she would get twenty-four different ones. They gave her everything she could ever want from a family of her own&#x2014;joy and laughter, pathos and tears, triumph and pride. Sometimes they broke her heart, but most of the time, they gave her a reason for living.<br><br>She loved her students from September to June, and when school ended, she sent them out the door, giving them back to their families, pounds heavier, inches taller, drilled in their multiplication and division tables, reading at grade level or better. In the fall, she shifted her attention to the next crop of students. And so it went, year after year. It was the most satisfying feeling in the world, and best of all, it was safe.<br><br>Having children of your own&#x2014;now, that was not so safe. Kids were part of you forever, subjecting you to crazed heights of joy and bitter depths of sorrow. Some people were cut out for that, others weren't. A good number weren't cut out for it but fell in love and had kids, anyway. Then they usually fell out of love and everyone within shouting distance got hurt. Charlie Hol-loway's parents were a case in point, Lily reflected.<br><br>"My Favorite Things" had been today's creative writing lesson. The children had three minutes to write down as many of their favorite things as possible. Lily always did the exercises right alongside her students, and she always took them seriously. The kids stayed more interested and involved that way. Her list, written hastily but neatly on a large flip chart, included:<br><br>Japanese satsumas <br>snow days <br>science projects <br>the sound of kids singing<br>TV miniseries <br>mystery novels <br>first day of school <br>take-out restaurants <br>sightseeing <br>stories that end happily ever after<br><br>She ripped down the chart and crumpled it into a ball. It was a little too revealing. Not that her list would surprise Crystal Holloway. They'd known each other since Lily was Charlie's age, maybe younger, and Crystal had been a gum-popping preteen babysitter.<br><br>What a long way we've come together, thought Lily. This was a new one for them both, though. Telling parents their child was failing third grade was hard enough. The fact that Lily and Crystal were best friends only made it worse. In doing what was best for Charlie, Lily was going to have to say some difficult things to her dearest friend. And on top of that, the divorced Holloways couldn't stand each other.<br><br></p><h2>Yoga of Netra Tantra:</h2><p>The Netra Tantra &#34;Tantra of the (Third) Eye (of Siva)&#34;, also called Mrtyujit (Conqueror of Death), is one of the fundamental scriptures of non-dualist Kashmir Saivism or Trika. It is the only Tantra having the Third Eye of Siva as title and theme, and it contains three important chapters on Yoga, relating to three ways of overcoming death. This book, besides giving an introduction to the Tantra, contains an interpretation of the three chapters; Chapter 1deals with the Eye of Siva, Chapter 7 with subtle Yoga, and Chapter 8 with supreme Yoga. The same texts are presented in Devanagari, transliteration and translation, including the eleventh-century commentary of Ksemaraja, illustrious disciple of Abhinava� gupta . The Appendix contains illustrations of the theme of trinetra from different sources, mainly connected with Kashmir, as well as a comparative study on &#34;The spiritual eye in the Christian mystical traditions&#34;. This book is an important contribution to the studies on non-dualist Saivism or Trika, and especially to its Yoga.</p><p></p><h2>Charleston: A Bloomsbury House and Garden</h2><p>Set in the heart of the Sussex downs, Charleston Farmhouse is the most important remaining example of Bloomsbury decorative style.<br>When painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Vanessa's two children and Duncan's friend David Garnett moved there in 1916, they took on an old building and overgrown garden ripe for transformation. Undaunted by the lack of creature comforts, Duncan and Vanessa set about obliterating the awful wallpaper they found with paint and stencils and decorating the furniture they bought in junk shops. The result was a series of unique interiors that formed a backdrop for decades of Bloomsbury artistic and literary activity, which only drew to a close with Duncan's death in 1978.<br>Charleston: A Bloomsbury House and Garden celebrates the artistic talents, wit and originality of those who lived at Charleston. Quentin Bell, the younger son of Clive and Vanessa Bell, and his daughter Virginia Nicholson tell the story of this unique house, linking it with some of the leading cultural figures who were invited as guests. Frequent visitors included Vanessa's sister, Virginia Woolf, who lived only four miles away; the writer Lytton Strachey; the economist Maynard Keynes, who stayed so long he had a room permanently set aside for him; and the art critic Roger Fry, who designed the curious fireplaces and a new studio.<br>The house and garden are portrayed through Alen MacWeeney's atmospheric photographs, featuring entire rooms, specific decorative details, paintings and sculptures. Pictures from Vanessa's family album convey the flavor of the household in its heyday, while some of the many canvases painted there attest to the importance of Charleston as a source of inspiration.</p><p>Quentin Bell, held chairs in Fine Art and History of Art at the universities of Leeds, Oxford and Sussex.a fabulous DIY story, with lashings of eminent Edwardians Independent Here is a view of the quintessential Bloomsbury house through the eyes of a child and grandchild of Clive and Vanessa Bell.

Her many subsequent books include works on women writers and painters; the politics of fertility and aging; and <i>The Whole Woman</i> (1999), which takes stock of the current situation of the feminist movement.<br>Greer has made a career of the controversial polemic, most explosively in the 1970s with The Female Eunuch, brazenly arguing for women's sexual liberation. Decades later, the Australian-born sensualist seeks to redress another wrong: heterosexual women's insensitivity to the boy as sexual object. Considering the utter fetishization of contemporary youth culture, it's difficult to sustain the argument that nubile lads are being neglected. But the present day isn't the volume's strength; the most modern icons include Elvis, Boy George, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison and Robert Plant-nary a boy band member. The more compelling passages investigate shifting representations in classical art-Cupid first depicted as sly aggressor, seducing his own mother, only to be desexualized in the more restrictive 19th century, conveniently cloaked by a drape or angel wing. Except for a final chapter that glosses over the works of female artists, Greer hardly plunges into her initial aim "to advance women's reclamation of their capacity for and right to visual pleasure." What does it mean for women to sexualize dewy, girlish boys created by male artists? To swoon over Caravaggio's provocative urchins, Michelangelo's languorous Dying Slave or Eakins's supple-skinned bathers? It's not clear, but then nuance has never really interested Greer. Short on argument but long on lush reproductions of languid young men, the collection is better viewed than read. 200 color and b/w photographs and illustrations. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

According to premier rock critic Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone, this is the best rock novel ever written!

The book draws on illustrations from ten of Ipcar&#39;s previous children&#39;s books, most of which are out of print, as well as some of her fine art paintings.

Her unique and distinctively modern style helped change the role of artwork in children&#39;s literature. She was born in 1917 in Vermont and raised in New York City. Her parents, the famed sculptor William Zorach and artist Marguerite Zorach, bought a farm on Georgetown Island in 1923, where Ipcar first summered and later moved with her husband Adolph in 1937. She still lives on the farm and continues to paint almost every day. In 2010, she released her first new book in more than twenty years, Dahlov Ipcar&#39;s Farmyard Alphabet, a board book with original text and illustrations taken from eleven of her previously published books.<p>"Ipcar has left behind a wonderful and extensive legacy...She produced many enduring children&#x2019;s books of course, such as <i>Hardcrabble Harvest</i>, <i>The Cat at Night</i>, and <i>Wild and Tame Animals</i>...The disarming fact that Ipcar worked up until her last day calls to mind another hard worker, Big Betty, the one horse of Ipcar&#x2019;s classic picture book, <i>One Horse Farm</i>...a perfect example of Ipcar&#x2019;s timeless illustrations, their exquisite palette, quietly expressive figures and sublime backdrops offering an absorbing visual narrative...When I think of Dahlov Ipcar&#x2019;s legacy many things come to mind, but her concern for personal character and integrity, so deftly and powerfully expressed, are something for which I will always carry a grateful memory." <br>- from <i>A Farewell to Dahlov Ipcar</i>, <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Feb. 2017</p> (2017-02-23)</p><h2>Gagging of God, The</h2><p>Author D.A.

Carson helps evangelicals respond with a clear, scholarly voice to the question, &#34;Is Jesus the only way to God?&#34; This book affirms the deep need for the Gospel&#39;s exclusive message in today&#39;s increasingly pluralistic global community. Most of the recent writings on religious pluralism have focused on specific aspects of the subject: shifts in Western thought and interpretation, the growing cultural and racial diversity of Western nations, the fraying of evangelical thought and life, and related topics. In contrast, The Gagging of God offers an in-depth look at the big picture. It shows how the many ramifications of pluralism are all parts of a whole, then offers a systemic Christian experience.</p><h2>A century of Ford and New Holland farm equipment</h2><p>This book follows a trail of products and politics through 100 years of progress.

Born in New York City in the 1930s, she currently lives in San Francisco, where she works as a writer and teacher. Her most recent books include <i>Pieces of a Song: Selected Poems</i> and <i>Loba, Books I and II</i>.Di Prima, perhaps the best known and certainly among the most talented of the beat generation poets, captures the heady atmosphere of New York's avant-garde community in the 1950s and 1960s, while rendering her own life with intimacy and grace. Born in Brooklyn in the mid-1930s, she remembers her Italian immigrant grandmother with great affection. But she describes frightening incidents from her earliest childhood: her father, a sullen, brooding, man, once beat her until her nose bled; her relationship with her mother was equally abusive. In elementary school, di Prima was bullied relentlessly; it was not until she entered Hunter High School for gifted students that she found a circle of friends; there, reading the great poets, she resolved to become a poet herself. Leaving Swarthmore College after what she perceived as unproductive years, di Prima returned to New York City, and embarked on an independent life as a writer. She describes her bohemian lifestyle love affairs with men and women, experiments with drugs with honesty and wit. Friend to many of the best known figures of the beat world, including Allen Ginsberg, Audre Lorde and LeRoi Jones, di Prima found fulfillment in her work as an editor and poet, and as a single mother. She tells her story well, skillfully interweaving events with lyrical commentary on her inner life. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Doom of the Dragon: A Dragonships of Vindras Novel (Dragonships of Vindras, 4)</h2><p><p>The climatic fourth and final novel in the Dragonships of Vindras series, <i>Doom of the Dragon</i>, by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. </p><p>In three previous novels, Skylan Ivorson overcame obstacles that would have defeated a lesser man, rising from obscurity to become the Chief of Chiefs of the fearsome Vindrasi who sail their living dragonships far and wide to raid and plunder for the glory of the gods. However, a cruel twist of fate struck him down before he and his beloved could complete their quest for the five sacred dragonbones that would summon the great dragon Ilyrion and save their people from destruction at the hands of an evil god. But even true death is denied him, and his destiny is unfulfilled.</p><p>Caught between life and death, he must lead those who journeyed with him to battle the evil god and the vast army of the god and his human emperor. Skylan must fight as he never has before to win back his life and his love, while seeking the last Spiritbone--the key to summoning the ultimate victory--before it can be snatched away by the forces of evil. </p><p>With <i>Doom of the Dragon, </i>Weis and Hickman have crafted a pulse-pounding fantasy adventure that brings their great <i>Dragonships of Vindras </i>saga to a rousing, satisfying conclusion that will stir the passions of their legions of fans.</p></p><p>Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman published their first novel in the Dragonlance&#x2122; Chronicles, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, in 1984. Over twenty years later, they are going strong after collaborating on more than thirty novels. Alone or together with other coauthors, Weis and Hickman have published more than one hundred books, including novels and collections of short stories, as well as role-playing games and other gaming products.Hickman and Weis&#39;s new fantasy series evokes memories of Norse mythology. The gods are battling, and the fate of the Vindras gods lies in the hands of the younger generation, which is off to a bumbling start. The five sacred hidden bones of the Vektan dragons must be found and protected from interlopers in order to preserve the Vindras&#39; way of life and independence. Stefan Rudnicki brings the characters vividly to life. He speaks with the voice of authority and sounds as if he&#39;s reciting the oral history of the Vindras. Consistent with the warrior mentality of the Vindras, Rudnicki adopts a firm tone with an undercurrent of restrained violence that is briefly lifted from time to time for sporadic moments of tenderness.

Taulbert takes the reader on a journey out of the segregated South of his childhood and into the explosive era of the 1960s. This is the story of what happened when, at age 17, Taulbert boarded the Illinois Central train on one of its last runs out of Greenville, Mississippi, to St. Louis, the city of his dreams. The reality he found was not what he expected, but it held its own warmth and promise. It was the world of the Lively Stone Church of God and the people who gathered there to sing, worship, and encourage each other as they had down south. It was the world of Brazier&#39;s Confectionery, the little black-owned corner grocery store, of the people who lived above the store and worked hard to make their northern dreams come true.

"The left eventually broke his heart," wrote John Updike of Capp. A genuine American mythmaker and celebrated funnyman, Capp used his strip for years to expose greed, corruption and social injustice, while bringing belly laughs and dramatic suspense to the lives of millions of people every day.<br><br> Theroux, however, dives head-first into the often glossed-over side of Capp, delivering a keen (but not without compassion) analysis of Capp's degeneration into a bitter, disillusioned, conservative extremist, who began using his strip in later years to attack the very causes he once championed. This is a rich and compelling investigation into the psyche of a paradoxical American icon, who at the height of his fame was one of America's highest-paid and most well-known entertainers, gracing the cover of <i>Time</i> and other magazines, and franchising <i>Li'l Abner</i> into film, theater, radio, merchandising and more. Illustrated throughout with examples of Capp's cartoons.</p><p>Alexander Theroux is an award-winning novelist, poet, and teacher whose prose works include Laura Warholic or, The Sexual Intellectual, Estonia, and the two artist monographs The Strange Case of Edward Gorey and The Enigma of Al Capp. His novel Darconville&#x2019;s Cat was chosen by Anthony Burgess as one of the 99 greatest post-war novels.

His doctrine of libertinage as expounded in <i>Philosophy in the Boudoir</i> - his masterpiece - now reads like a blueprint for those manifestos drawn up will over a century later by Andre Breton; indeed <i>Philosophy in the Boudoir</i> has often been regarded as being amongst the first Surrealist texts - the others also being works by De Sade. In the course of this book - erotic, comical, and terrifyingly bleak in turn - he contrives to heap scorn on Christianity, God, and the Church, religion in general, history, marriage and the nuclear family, morality, all love other than sexual love, faith, hope and charity, parenthood, vaginal sex; i.e. all forms of humanity and virtue. At the same time, he advocates atheism, murder and reflexive crimes, torture, cruelty, abortion, all kind of sexual perversion, incest, adultery, self-abuse, ad infinitum; his sexually violent visions mark him as a precursor of modern psychology. <p>The modern imagination starts here.</p></p><h2>Countering Hostile Surveillance: Detect, Evade, and Neutralize Physical Surveillance Threats</h2><p>From the author of the highly regarded training manuals <b>Secrets of Surveillance</b> and <b>Surveillance Countermeasures</b> comes the next course in identifying and evading hostile surveillance in the real world.<br><br>Every day in all parts of the world, hostile surveillance forces are stalking and exploiting unwitting prey -- be they private citizens, corporate employees or national security agents.

The story of a crack butt-fighting unit called the B-team, a legendary Butt Hunter's formidable daghter, and some of the ugliest and meanest butts ever to roam the face of the Earth. A story of endurance that takes Zack on an epic journey across the Great Windy Desert, through the Brown Forest, and over the Sea of Butts before descending into the heart of an explosive buttcano to confront the biggest, ugliest, and meanest butt of them all!<br><br>It's a story you and your butt will never forget!</p><p>While wisely rated G for Gross ("Contains immature material not suitable for adults"), Andy Griffiths' very funny debut novel will almost certainly blow away--perhaps literally, stinkingly--anyone of any age who's ever suspected that their backside might be up to something.<p> </p><p> Translated from the Australian (sold Down Under as "The Day My <i>Bum</i> Went Psycho"), this adventure begins with the nighttime flight of our 12-year-old protagonist Zach's pale little heinie and doesn't let up for over 200 pages--most of which are filled almost exclusively with the word "butt." At first, Zach believes his butt might be leading some sort of minor butt rebellion, but the plot quickly thickens to include a global army of feral butts, the "greatest buttcano in the history of the world," and a head-butt "rearrangement" conspiracy that goes all the way to the... um, bottom. Our well-meaning but naive hero Zach soon gets mixed up with the butt-fighting "B-team" (the Kicker, the Kisser, and the Smacker, who all "love the smell of freshly smacked butt in the morning!"), fires his very first 4502-LL ("The LL stood for Laxative Launcher"), learns how to "butt-hop" ("The average butt has enough gas to propel itself and a rider for twenty minutes...."), and goes on a long, wild chase involving cluster butts, buttcatchers, kamikaze butts, stinkants, and even the fearsome Stenchgantor, "the Great Unwiped Butt." (And that's not even counting all those seagoing butt piranhas and poopoises.)</p><p> </p><p> Griffiths surely likes the cheap laughs and doesn't miss a single opportunity for buttly wordplay (from "high-frequency emissions" to the smell-ranking "Rectum scale"), but that doesn't make <i>The Day My Butt Went Psycho</i> any less clever--the fast-moving plot has as many double-crosses as double entendres, and Griffiths weaves in some pretty brilliant ideas.

Her aunt Vera Hillyard, a rigidly respectable woman, was convicted and hanged for the crime, but the reason for her desperate deed died with her. Thirty years later, a probing journalist pushes Faith to look back to the day when her aunt took knife in hand and walked into a child&#39;s nursery. Through the eyes of a woman trying to understand an unspeakable, inexplicable family tragedy, Barbara Vine leads us through a shadow land of illicit lust, intimate sins, and unspoken passions-to a shattering and illuminating climax, as inevitable as it is unexpected. In this enthralling masterpiece, a great crime writer has achieved both a flawlessly crafted novel of psychological suspense and a deeply probing work of literary art.</p><p></p><h2>Grail Quest Book Two.

His books are classics in the fields of inspiration and spirituality. Although best known for As a Man Thinketh, he authored several other books that deal with the power of thought including The Path to Prosperity, The Mastery of Destiny, The Way of Peace, and Entering the Kingdom.Literally a blueprint on living, this little gem serves as a course of action for approaching life in a meaningful manner.

This slim, hero-worshipping volume resulted, and one can understand why the artist asked Logsdon to desist from his snooping. Among those with whom Logsdon chatted were lumberman Ralph Cline (immortalized in Wyeth's The Patriot ), Willard Snowden (subject of The Drifter ), farmers Karl Kuerner and Forrest Wall, and the family of Christina Olson (the woman portrayed in Christina's World ). The shallow interviews tell us little about Wyeth, only that he was a fine person, highly independent, not dogmatic, etc. The author also offers a puerile account of his tracking of Wyeth himself and of his wife's polite rebuffs. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Growing up on a farm, journalist Logsdon had admired Wyeth's uncanny ability to see rural life as a farmer might and had made him his artistic hero. Eventually his search for the man behind the paintings led him to the Olson farm, Chadds Ford, and other Wyeth shrines; he interviewed Wyeth's friends and models and even spoke with Wyeth himself on several occasions. In the end the reclusive Wyeth remains a mystery; we learn more about Wyeth's models and about Logsdon himself than we do about the artist. Nonetheless, Logsdon's engaging and often humorous effort to reveal Wyeth's character will be of interest to his admirers. Douglas G.

In response to the recent upsurge of interest, her 2009 paperback has been updated with details of the discovery plus new illustrations, and a larger typeface for easier readability. Carson's premise is that for centuries the vision of Richard III has been dominated by the fictional creations of Thomas More and Shakespeare. Many voices, some of them eminent and scholarly, have urged a more reasoned view to replace the traditional black portrait. This book seeks to redress the balance by examining the events of his reign as they actually happened, based on reports in the original sources. Eschewing the overlay of assumptions so beloved by historians, she instead traces actions and activities of the principal characters, using facts and time-lines revealed in documentary evidence. In the process Carson dares to investigate areas where historians fear to tread, and raises many controversial questions.</p></p><p>After studying at the Royal College of Music, <b>Annette Carson</b> worked for several years in the entertainment industry while indulging a leisure interest in aerobatics, on which she is a renowned expert and has contributed to Encyclop�dia Britannica.

In his latest, The City &amp; the City, Mieville has outdone himself, giving us a multi-layered urban fantasy of extraordinary complexity and depth.<br><br>The story begins when Tyador Borlu, senior detective in the Extreme Crime Squad of the city of Beszel, is called to the scene of a particularly vicious homicide. When the victim turns out to be a young female student with dubious political connections and a controversial history, the investigation spills over into the neighboring city of Ul Qoma. Once there, Borlu enters a labyrinth of violence and corruption that will alter the course of his career.<br><br>The City &amp; the City is a brilliantly conceived, masterfully executed novel whose intricate plot encompasses myth and legend, political and cultural divisions, corporate greed, and the arcane forces that move behind the scenes of a beautifully realized urban landscape. Effortlessly blurring the boundaries between mystery, fantasy, and mainstream fiction, it is the most impressive, fully developed work to date by a writer of vast ambition and seemingly limitless gifts.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2009:</strong> The city is Beszel, a rundown metropolis on the eastern edge of Europe. The other city is Ul Qoma, a modern Eastern European boomtown, despite being a bit of an international pariah. What the two cities share, and what they don't, is the deliciously evocative conundrum at the heart of China Mieville's <em>The City &amp; The City</em>. Mieville is well known as a modern fantasist (and urbanist), but from book to book he's tried on different genres, and here he's fully hard-boiled, stripping down to a seen-it-all detective's voice that's wonderfully appropriate for this story of seen and unseen. His detective is Inspector Tyador Borlu, a cop in Beszel whose investigation of the murder of a young foreign woman takes him back and forth across the highly policed border to Ul Qoma to uncover a crime that threatens the delicate balance between the cities and, perhaps more so, Borlu's own dissolving sense of identity. In his tale of two cities, Mieville creates a world both fantastic and unsettlingly familiar, whose mysteries don't end with the solution of a murder. --<em>Tom Nissley</em>China Mi�ville is the author of <b>King Rat</b>; <b>Perdido Street Station,</b> winner of the Arthur C.

Few institutions approach the richness of The Museum of Modern Art's holdings in painting, sculpture, drawing, prints, illustrated books, architectural models and drawings, graphic and industrial design, photography, film, video and multimedia installations. In this volume, some 350 highlights--23 of which are new to this edition--from the Museum's six curatorial departments, are interwoven to present a sumptuous and broadly chronological overview that takes readers from Post-Impressionism to contemporary art. Every work that was executed in color is reproduced in <i>MoMA Highlights</i> in vibrant hues, and each is accompanied by a brief commentary. Updated and revised, this book is the definitive guide to the broad scope of MoMA's collection. Also updated and expanded, The Museum of Modern Art recently reopened on November 20, 2004 in its newly designed building by architect Yoshio Taniguchi. Founded in 1929 as an educational institution, MoMA is dedicated to being the foremost museum of modern art in the world. The ultimate purpose of the Museum declared at its founding, is to acquire the best modern works of art in all visual mediums.</p><p>One expects any museum to produce greatest hits package type books along with the t-shirts, postcards, and boxer shorts that make a gift shop the driving engine of any decent museum. And if you thought this surely must be one of these kind of books, you&#x2019;d not be faulted for that. However, the newly-expanded and revised version of this book (which is slightly less White Male-centric than its predecessor) is something of a classic when it comes to writing about modern art in a way that's both accessible and informative. Not to say that it's a masterpiece of art history, but it is a rather marvelous look at 350 major works from the Museum of Modern Art's considerably deep collection. One wishes many of these items could be on permanent display, but of course MOMA would have to be 50 times its size to showcase all of its holdings. You'll find a huge variety of disciplines, including video and multimedia works, design and painting, spanning pretty much the entire gamut of art, making it a model gift for the art lover in your circle of friends. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i></p><h2>Island of the Lizard King</h2><p>Cover worn, page edges tanned.

Wally Hope was a visionary and a freethinker, whose life had a profound influence on many in the culture of the UK Underground and beyond. He was an important figure in what may loosely be described as the organization of the Windsor Free Festival from 1972 to 1974, and provided the impetus for the embryonic Stonehenge Free Festival. Wally was arrested and incarcerated in a mental institution after having been found in possession of a small amount of LSD. He was later released, and subsequently died. The official verdict was that Russell committed suicide, although Rimbaud uncovered strong evidence that he was murdered. <i>The Last of the Hippies</i> fast became the seminal text of what was then known as anarcho-punk and which later blossomed into the antiglobalization movement. This revised edition comes complete with a new introduction in which Rimbaud questions some of the premises that he laid down in the original.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Penny Rimbaud</b> is a writer, poet, philosopher, painter, musician, and activist.

Richard Feynman is the kind of physicist you&#39;d expect to meet in the pages of a Douglas Adams book..only he is for real!</p><p>A series of anecdotes shouldn't by rights add up to an autobiography, but that's just one of the many pieces of received wisdom that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88) cheerfully ignores in his engagingly eccentric book, a bestseller ever since its initial publication in 1985. Fiercely independent (read the chapter entitled "Judging Books by Their Covers"), intolerant of stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check out "Is Electricity Fire?"), unafraid to offend (see "You Just <i>Ask</i> Them?"), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to enjoy <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</i> simply as a bunch of hilarious yarns with the smart-alecky author as know-it-all hero. At some point, however, attentive readers realize that underneath all the merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up on seemingly insoluble problems; and total disrespect for fancy ideas that have no grounding in the real world. Feynman himself had all these qualities in spades, and they come through with vigor and verve in his no-bull prose. No wonder his students--and readers around the world--adored him. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Yellow Raft in Blue Water</h2><p>Follows three generations of Indian women beset by hardships and torn by angry secrets, yet inextricably bound together by the indissoluble bonds of kinship</p><p>Michael Dorris is the author of <em> A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, The Broken Cord, Working Men, Morning Girl,</em> and <em> Guests,</em> and co-author with Louise Erdrich of <em> The Crown of Columbus.</em>Critics have described Michael Dorris's acclaimed debut as a braid: Each life is one strand interwoven to create a whole. To uphold that imagery, Barbara Rosenblat becomes three women in one for this production. She begins as Rayona, a teenager experiencing growing pains while dealing with her mother's illness. As Christine nears death, mother and daughter return to the reservation. With ease, Rosenblat switches from the higher, innocent voice of young Rayona to the gruffer, brassy voice of Christine, a woman who has always acted impulsively on her heart's desires. The final third of the book is Ida's story, the past that brings truth to the present. While her Native American inflection does not sound authentic, Rosenblat fittingly uses a deep, cold, snappish tone to convey the matriarchal character. Three strong women, one strong voice tells their story.

It might not work, mind you, but that's hardly the point. In playwright Rachel Joyce's pitch-perfect first novel, Harold wins us over with his classic antiheroism. Setting off on the long journey, he wears the wrong jacket, doesn't have a toothbrush, and leaves his phone at home--in short, he is wholly, endearingly unprepared. But as he travels, Harold finally has time to reflect on his failings as a husband, father, and friend, and this helps him become someone we (and, more important, his wife Maureen) can respect. After walking for a while in Harold Fry's very human shoes, you might find that your own fit a bit better. --<i>Mia Lipman</i><p>The author, Rachel Joyce, has written over twenty original afternoon plays for BBC Radio 4, and has created major adaptations for the Classic series and Woman&#x2019;s Hour, as well as a TV drama adaptation for BBC2.

James Shelley becomes a black ops sniper working for the Red&#x2014;a suspected rogue artificial intelligence that is ripped from today&#x2019;s headlines.<br><br>James Shelley has left his lover, Delphi, and his companion-in-arms, Jayne Vasquez, with a fortune acquired from a fallen oligarch. They believe him to be dead, and he doesn&#x2019;t try to set the record straight. His long-running question has been answered: There are other soldiers like him who have served the purposes of the Red&#x2014;and he has accepted his place among them. As a soldier of the Red he pursues covert missions designed to nudge history away from existential threats&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t mean the world is growing more orderly. It&#x2019;s only in the froth of a &#x201c;managed chaos&#x201d; that human potential can grow and thrive.

That means there are no &#x2018;sides.&#x2019; There are no real allies, no fixed enemies, no certain battlefield. Conflict occurs across financial, communications, propaganda, terroristic, and military channels in a continuously shifting matrix that can destroy a culture, crash an economy, or ignite combat depending on the weight and direction of competing interests&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Including our interests,&#x201d; Lieutenant Logan interjects, like this is some kind of valid counterpoint to my argument.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not.<br> <br>&#x201c;Including our interests,&#x201d; I acknowledge. &#x201c;Whatever the fuck those are.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m James Shelley, captain of ETM Strike Squad 7-1&#x2014;a linked combat squad that doesn&#x2019;t exist in any official US Army record. Ray Logan is my lieutenant. Our low-voiced conversation is taking place a few steps away from the six soldiers assigned to ETM 7-1.<br> <br>We occupy a temporary berth set up in the torpedo room of a US Navy Virginia-class fast-attack submarine that is presently passing beneath the Arctic Ocean&#x2019;s winter ice pack. The remainder of the squad is asleep in temporary bunks, stacked two high and set up side by side in a long row between the green tubes of racked torpedoes. The squad is mostly out of sight, at rest in the lower bunks, with their gear stored in good order on top. Only me and Logan are up, conferencing at one end of a narrow passage that runs between the foot of the bunks and one of the torpedo racks.<br> <br>&#x201c;The point,&#x201d; I go on, &#x201c;is that the identities of the good guys and bad guys will change; they have to change, as circumstances change. So you never know who the enemy will be next year, or in the next engagement.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ray Logan is twenty-four, making him a year younger than me. At five-ten, he&#x2019;s not a tall man, but his lean build and chiseled Caucasian features could have gotten him cast as an extra if he&#x2019;d tried Hollywood instead of the army. He&#x2019;s a hell of a fighter who likes to be at the front of any assault, so it&#x2019;s almost surreal to see him cast an uneasy glance over his shoulder, as if he&#x2019;s worried about someone in the squad listening in. I follow his gaze, but all I see is Carl Escamilla&#x2019;s big, ugly bare foot sticking out from the last bunk.<br> <br>Logan lowers his voice even further. &#x201c;Jesus, Shelley, I just never thought the fucking Canadians would turn out to be the bad guys. I mean, my mom is Canadian.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonlinear war,&#x201d; I remind him. &#x201c;Shifting alliances. The target is Canadian. If it makes you feel any better, what&#x2019;s going on within the target might have nothing to do with the Canadian government or even a Canadian corporation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our present mission is codenamed Palehorse Keep, and like every mission we undertake, it&#x2019;s been assigned to us by the Red. Our target is an exploratory oil-drilling platform named Deep Winter Sigil. It&#x2019;s overwintering in contested marine territory that Canada wants to claim for its own&#x2014;but we&#x2019;re not out to referee a territorial dispute. The intelligence we&#x2019;ve received indicates something unusual is going on in laboratories aboard the platform, evidenced by security so tight, even the Red can&#x2019;t penetrate it.<br> <br>When a secret is that well kept, we assume it&#x2019;s dangerous, possibly an existential threat.<br> <br>So our mission is to approach in stealth, kick in the doors, take command of the facility, and determine what is being hidden there. We call this kind of assignment a look-and-see mission. We&#x2019;ve done two others in recent months. Both turned out to be illicit drug labs, which is not something we&#x2019;d ordinarily go after, but that&#x2019;s the risk of a look-and-see.<br> <br>I think we&#x2019;re being sent out repeatedly because the Red is searching for a specific operation. What that operation might be, I don&#x2019;t know. We&#x2019;re told to go look, and until we do, we don&#x2019;t know what we&#x2019;ll find. It could be anything, from an insurmountable defense to an innocent operation.<br> <br>Logan gets a sour look. Like me&#x2014;like all of us&#x2014;he used to be regular army. Nine months ago he was part of a US training force in Bolivia. His CO ordered the squad to accompany a local unit on an interdiction, which is just a kind of look-and-see. Logan had a bad feeling; he argued the intelligence was faulty. He was right. When the local unit kicked in the door, there were kids inside; no bad guys. They lit up the place anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;I fucking hate look-and-see missions,&#x201d; he says with bitter sincerity.<br> <br>I want to tell him I hate them too, but what I say instead is, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to wake the squad. Be ready to take them through the mission plan one more time before we go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our chain of command is simple. We have officers because someone has to be in charge, but we don&#x2019;t use designated ranks among our regular soldiers. It isn&#x2019;t necessary. None of them are here for the pay or the promotional opportunities.<br> <br>My focus shifts, picking out a half-seen, translucent icon floating at the bottom of my field of view. It&#x2019;s the command node for gen-com. My attention causes it to brighten, making it stand out from the icons around it&#x2014;all of them part of the display projected by the optical overlay that I wear like contact lenses in my eyes.<br> <br>The icon offers me a menu but I ignore it, muttering, &#x201c;Send a wakeup call.&#x201d; My command initiates a signal that&#x2019;s relayed point to point to my soldiers.<br> <br>Every soldier in my LCS has an ocular overlay like mine, and every one of us also has a skullnet: a mesh of fine wires implanted beneath the scalp that monitors and regulates brain activity. Each overlay receives my command and relays it to the soldier&#x2019;s skullnet; the simple AI that oversees the skullnet responds, triggering a waking routine.<br> <br>There is no moment of transition, no confusion, no sluggishness. My soldiers awaken simultaneously, with machine precision. Some stretch, some cough, but within ten seconds every one of them appears&#x2014;sitting at the end of the bunks or standing in the passage&#x2014;but all looking at me with an alert gaze, eager to learn our status.<br> <br>Logan takes over. &#x201c;Piss and wash up. You&#x2019;ve got five minutes, and then we&#x2019;re going to review roles and rules one more time.&#x201d;<br> <br>All of my soldiers in ETM 7-1 were officially &#x201c;killed in action&#x201d; or &#x201c;died of wounds,&#x201d; but death grants them no reprieve from the endless training and mission prep inherent to the army, because their best chance of surviving a mission is to understand it all the way down to their bones.<br> <br>� � � �<br> <br>Seventy minutes later, the sub&#x2019;s commander calls down from the control room to let us know we are ten minutes from our designated drop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holiday&#x2019;s over!&#x201d; Logan barks. &#x201c;And goddamn about time. Suit up!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hoo-yah!&#x201d; Alex Tran proclaims, exchanging a fist bump with Thomas Dunahee.<br> <br>And then everyone moves at once. Our packs, our weapons, and our equipment are all ready. The only prep work remaining is to get into our thermal gear.<br> <br>Crammed shoulder to shoulder in the tight passage, we wriggle into thermal skins, pulling them on over the silky, high-tech shorts and T-shirts that are our standard-issue under-gear.<br> <br>The skins are 1.5 centimeters of supple insulation that will ensure we don&#x2019;t die of hypothermia&#x2014;although we might die of heat exhaustion if our exit from the sub is delayed.<br> <br>I wear full leggings like everyone else, pulling them on over my prosthetic legs. The robot legs don&#x2019;t need to be warm to work, but they are a heat sink. If I don&#x2019;t insulate, they&#x2019;ll drain the warmth from my body.<br> <br>A gray, tight-fitting thermal hood with a full-face mask goes on next. I fit it carefully. There won&#x2019;t be a chance to adjust it after we launch, so I make sure it&#x2019;s comfortable, and that it&#x2019;s positioned so it won&#x2019;t obscure my vision or obstruct my breathing.<br> <br>Already I&#x2019;m starting to sweat, but I add another layer: an insulated combat uniform printed in gray-white arctic camo. It&#x2019;s identical to the uniform I wore on the First Light mission, lacking insignia or identifying marks, making no claim that we are part of the United States military&#x2014;because we are not part of it. We only pretend to be.<br> <br>It helps in getting around.<br> <br>I pull on my boots, and then strap on a thigh holster holding a 9-millimeter SIG Sauer. A pair of thin shooting gloves, heated with embedded wires, protects my hands. My armored vest goes on last, and then I cast my gaze back along the line.<br> <br>Boots stomp the deck as the squad finishes their prep. Hunched shoulders straighten. Gray-hooded heads turn toward me. Only their eyes are visible, pleading to be released into the cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sweet Jesus,&#x201d; Dunahee mutters. &#x201c;Another minute in this heat and I&#x2019;m going to puke.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s crammed into the middle of the passage. Behind him is Fadul, who has zero tolerance for griping. &#x201c;Puke on me and I&#x2019;ll stuff you under the ice,&#x201d; she advises him in her quiet, dangerous tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fadul, you&#x2019;re supposed to terrify the enemy,&#x201d; I remind her as I get my pack off the top bunk closest to me. &#x201c;Not your brothers and sisters in arms.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her lips quirk in a ghost smile as she catches my eye. &#x201c;I can do both, Captain Shelley.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dunahee mutters, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s for damn sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pia Fadul is tall and lean, with black hair shaved to a stubble and wide, dark eyes. After the Coma Day nuclear strike, her unit, stationed in the Sahel, went without resupply or reinforcements for nine days, burning up their ammunition defending against an all-out assault. Her post was eventually overrun by a vengeful insurgent army. I&#x2019;ve seen some of the video recorded by her helmet cam. Not something you&#x2019;d want to see twice. There were no survivors. Officially, not even Fadul.<br> <br>Thomas Dunahee is Fadul&#x2019;s physical opposite: short, stocky, and fair-haired. He&#x2019;s a college graduate who was working in banking when Coma Day took down the economy, along with his parents and sisters who lived in Seattle. He enlisted as soon as the recruiter&#x2019;s office reopened. Fourteen months later, he was recruited by the Red.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dunahee, you&#x2019;re on drone duty. Logan, pass him the angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>The angel we brought with us is a different model than the one I used when I was regular army. It&#x2019;s smaller, with less range, and no satellite uplink capabilities. But with its wings folded against the blade of its fuselage, it&#x2019;s easy to carry on stealth missions. Logan retrieves it from an upper bunk and hands it off to Julian, who&#x2019;s behind him. &#x201c;Pass this down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bradley Julian is a Somali veteran. Tall and slender, with deep-black skin and dark eyes, he&#x2019;s our quiet intellectual who tends to overthink things. Right now, he&#x2019;s looking anxious behind his mask&#x2014;something Tran notices when Julian turns to hand off the angel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit, Julian,&#x201d; Tran says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not worried, are you?&#x201d; Tran&#x2019;s white teeth flash in a predatory grin as he takes the folded drone. &#x201c;We got no need to worry. With the Red on our side, we are fucking superheroes. No way we can lose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What the fuck did you just say?&#x201d; I ask him.<br> <br>The whole line freezes.<br> <br>Tran looks at me, confused, concerned, as he realizes he&#x2019;s in deep shit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you imagine yourself to be a superhero, Tran?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was only a joke, Captain Shelley. I was joking with Julian.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex Tran is skinny and dark-skinned, his African ancestry dominant over the Vietnamese. He&#x2019;s got three years of combat experience in the regular army, a bona fide war hero whose vigilance saved the lives of every soldier in his platoon when a suicide bomber targeted their operation in the Sahel. But in our outfit Tran is a rookie, the newest recruit to sign on for ETM. That&#x2019;s Existential Threat Management if anyone bothers to ask, which they don&#x2019;t, because everything that concerns our identities or our activities is classified. This mission is Tran&#x2019;s first as part of Strike Squad 7-1. He&#x2019;s still learning to live in our peculiar, parallel world, part of a ghost squad so secret even the army doesn&#x2019;t know we exist.<br> <br>Tran&#x2019;s gaze shifts uncertainly to Julian, before returning to me. &#x201c;Sir&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never fucking trust the Red,&#x201d; I warn him.<br> <br>No one moves, no one speaks. All eyes are on me, everyone aware that the outcome of this confrontation will directly affect the mission&#x2014;and I am furious. At Tran, at myself. Five minutes from our designated drop is a hell of a time to discover that I have failed to instill in my new recruit a clear picture of our situation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Operating on the wrong assumptions will get you killed fast, Tran. Just because the Red sent us here, because it assigned us this mission, that does not mean it&#x2019;s on our side or that it shares our interests. That does not mean it will aid us.&#x201d; I hesitate. I don&#x2019;t say it aloud, but I&#x2019;ve started to think the Red might not be a single entity, that instead it has multiple aspects, not all of them in sync. I&#x2019;m speaking to myself as much as to Tran when I say, &#x201c;We are on our own. Assume otherwise, and you put us all at risk.&#x201d;<br> <br>This lecture should induce a simple &#x201c;yes, sir&#x201d; and a humble apology, but what I get is an argument.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, I do understand. We operate on our own. We don&#x2019;t expect help. We don&#x2019;t ask for it. But we wouldn&#x2019;t be here, we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to operate at all, without oversight from the Red.&#x201d;<br> <br>One thing I&#x2019;ve noticed in the eighteen months since I fell back to Earth: It&#x2019;s not the recruits with a religious background who have a hard time wrapping their heads around the limited nature of the Red. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fan of comics, aren&#x2019;t you, Tran? Of superhero movies?&#x201d;<br> <br>He wants to deny it. I see it in the shift of his eyes. But lies don&#x2019;t work in our company because we all run FaceValue, an emotional analysis app that uses tone and facial expression to interpret mood and separate truth from lies. Tran remembers this and concedes the truth. &#x201c;Yes, sir. I am a fan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought so. From now on, you will forget every depiction you&#x2019;ve ever seen of all-powerful, world-eating AIs. We are not operating within comic book rules. The Red is not infallible. It is not all-knowing. Both its reach and its ability to react are limited. Its concern for our welfare is limited&#x2014;never forget that&#x2014;and it is not on the side of the angels which means that neither are we. We all have our reasons for being here, Tran. Just make sure your reasons are grounded in reality. We are not superheroes. We are not God&#x2019;s angels armed with flaming swords. We are just soldiers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tran is still rebellious. &#x201c;But sir, LT told me that on your last mission&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That the Red came through for us?&#x201d; I spare a brief glare for Logan, who looks at me, teeth gritted, eyes angry behind his mask. &#x201c;It happens,&#x201d; I affirm. &#x201c;We do not count on it. We do not expect assistance&#x2014;because most of the time we won&#x2019;t get it. Think about it. If the Red could control the situation, why send us in at all?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tran does as ordered, his brows knitting as he puzzles over my question. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying if we get into trouble, we have to get ourselves out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you operate under that knowledge? Under the certain knowledge that if we fuck up, no one&#x2014;nothing&#x2014;is going to save us? Because if you cannot, I invite you to stay behind.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tran is shocked at my offer. Insulted. Infused with an anger that stiffens his spine so that I swear he grows a quarter inch taller. &#x201c;No, sir. I am part of this squad. Maybe I don&#x2019;t understand yet how the whole thing works, but we are fighting against fucking Armageddon. I know that much. I don&#x2019;t give a shit if we&#x2019;re on our own or not. I intend to be part of ETM for the duration.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod, relax my shoulders, lower my voice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good to know. Now pass that fucking drone to Dunahee and make ...</p><h2>John Adams</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning, bestselling biography of America&#x2019;s founding father and second president that was the basis for the acclaimed HBO series, brilliantly told by master historian David McCullough.<br><br>In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second president of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as &#x201c;out of his senses&#x201d;; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history.<br> <br>This is history on a grand scale&#x2014;a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, <i>John Adams</i> is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p><p>Left to his own devices, John Adams might have lived out his days as a Massachusetts country lawyer, devoted to his family and friends. As it was, events swiftly overtook him, and Adams--who, David McCullough writes, was "not a man of the world" and not fond of politics--came to greatness as the second president of the United States, and one of the most distinguished of a generation of revolutionary leaders. He found reason to dislike sectarian wrangling even more in the aftermath of war, when Federalist and anti-Federalist factions vied bitterly for power, introducing scandal into an administration beset by other difficulties--including pirates on the high seas, conflict with France and England, and all the public controversy attendant in building a nation.<p> Overshadowed by the lustrous presidents Washington and Jefferson, who bracketed his tenure in office, Adams emerges from McCullough's brilliant biography as a truly heroic figure--not only for his significant role in the American Revolution but also for maintaining his personal integrity in its strife-filled aftermath. McCullough spends much of his narrative examining the troubled friendship between Adams and Jefferson, who had in common a love for books and ideas but differed on almost every other imaginable point. Reading his pages, it is easy to imagine the two as alter egos. (Strangely, both died on the same day, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.) But McCullough also considers Adams in his own light, and the portrait that emerges is altogether fascinating. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams</i>, and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

The book is divided into chapters based on the number of stitches in each cable two, three, four, etc. and includes detailed, step-by-step photos to guide beginning cablers through the process. Intermediate knitters will love the nearly 150 cable stitch patterns presented in both charted and written form. And advanced cablers will find lots of ideas for using cables and creating brand new ones.</p><p>Janet was on her way to medical school when she changed her mind and took a bit of a detour to the wilds of Montana. Out of necessity, she had to invent a way to make money, and it came in the form of knitting. Sixteen years, over one hundred designs, a quarterly newsletter, a DVD, and three knitting books later, she has established herself as an expert on cable knitting and design. Janet loves to share the joy of cables with knitters all over the world. She has taught for many fiber guilds, yarn stores, and knitting conferences. She writes about cables in a friendly, accessible way--it&#39;s almost as though Janet is sitting right there on the couch, knitting companionably with you. Join Janet for an exciting journey through the world of cable knitting and Aran sweater design.I am a guy who crochets, and until recently had a very basic knowledge of knitting. Then I somehow got acquainted with and found my passion in Aran designs. This book and another by Janet Szabo; Aran Sweater Design are at the very top of my list for their content. Janet's written instructions give me the sense that she is sitting here in front of me showing me in step by step detail how to accomplish various cable stitches with the greatest clarity I've seen. There are countless things that I didn't expect, such as correcting cables that have been knit the wrong direction and other helpful tips/techniques. There are a growing number of guys who are involved in the needle arts community, and I, for one, am grateful for this book as I learn, step by step, to create cabled knits that I can be proud of. --Amazon.com<br><br>. . . and I'm terrible with books. This one has a chart system that is very, very clear. Each of the hundreds of cables is illustrated and set off with its own chart (in black &amp; white). The chart system is easy to understand quickly. Many of the cables are simple and traditional, but Szabo has also included some more intricate ones with celtic-looking knots and braids. A number of these she created herself, and what's more, she describes in some detail how the reader can create her or his own cables. Near the front is a glossary of dozens of individual cable stitches, with precise instructions on how to create them. These become a reference for the charts used throughout the book. If there is any difficulty with this book it is that the stitch glossary is at the front, removed from the individual cable charts. I could not imagine a reasonable way to avoid this arrangement, and anyway it was at most a minor annoyance, since most of the stitches are relatively easy to learn. For the most complicated ones I just photocopied the stitch page and kept it with the chart page. The result was definitely worth the effort. I can only say that the subtitle "Volume One: the Basics" fills me with expectation. As for skill level, I think that anyone who knows how to knit and purl with some comfort can readily master most of the cables in this book.

After a sensational and celebrated trial, the convent's charismatic priest Urban Grandier�&#x20ac;&#x201d;accused of spiritually and sexually seducing the nuns in his charge�&#x20ac;&#x201d;was convicted of being in league with Satan. Then he was burned at the stake for witchcraft. </p> <p> In this classic work by the legendary Aldous Huxley�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a remarkable true story of religious and sexual obsession considered by many to be his nonfiction masterpiece�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a compelling historical event is clarified and brought to vivid life. </p></p><p>Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) is the author of the classic novels Brave New World, Eyeless in Gaza, and The Genius and the Goddess, as well as such critically acclaimed nonfiction works as The Devils of Loudun, The Perennial Philosophy, and The Doors of Perception.<br><br>Matthew Lloyd Davies is a veteran actor, audiobook narrator, and director. Throughout his acting career, he has made regular appearances with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal National Theatre, in the West End, on international tours, and in award-winning television shows and films.&#34;Huxley has reconstructed with skill, learning and horror one of the most appalling incidents in the history of witch-hunting during its seventeenth-century heyday. The Devils of Loudun is fascinating, erudite, and instinct with intellectual vitality&#34; * Times Literary Supplement * &#34;Huxley&#39;s analysis of motive, his exposition of the unconscious causes of behaviour, his exposure of the perversions to which religious emotion is subject, his discursions on the witch cult, on mass hysteria, on sexual eccentricity have the brilliance that all his writing has had from the very beginning&#34; * Spectator * &#34;One of Huxley&#39;s best books&#34; * Guardian * &#34;His masterpiece, and perhaps the most enjoyable book about spirituality ever written.

It went on to establish a number of other &#34;firsts&#34; during its illustrious combat history in this theater. Flying P-40 Warhawks, the pilots of the 57th entered combat in August 1942 and fought throughout the final Allied advance from El Alamein through the Axis surrender in Tunisia, the capture of Sicily and the invasion of Italy. Converting to the P-47D Thunderbolt in late 1943, the 57th continued pounding the retreating Axis forces in Italy until the end of the war in Europe. The 57th Fighter Group produced a number of aces during the war, and was also recognized for its pioneering achievements in the fighter-bomber role.</p><p>Carl Molesworth, a resident of Mount Vernon, Washington, USA, is a former newspaper and magazine editor now working as a freelance writer and editor.

After describing the surprisingly fragile crafts, he concentrates on the men who fly them, dedicated, highly skilled and supremely confident; he sketches several memorable portraits, especially of the higher-ranking officers. But the best is reserved for last as Gann follows Cecil Hopper through his training to become a U-2 pilot: his initial interview in which he demonstrates a mix of self-esteem and diffidence, his inaugural solo in the spy plane, his first mission in the Far East in which he comes dangerously close to disaster. The book is stirring and suspenseful. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The U-2 and SR-71 spy planes are euphemistically called "articles" by the CIA to help keep their existence and use quiet. Pilots of the 99th squadron at Beale Air Force Base in northern California fly these planes and go on high-altitude intelligence gathering missions over the world's hot spots. Popular aviation novelist Gann ( The Black Angel , LJ 9/15/87) provides interesting accounts of the brave pilots, the secret missions, and the aircraft they fly to the edge of space. The result is informative and entertaining--nonfiction that reads like a novel. Flying enthusiasts and general readers as well will enjoy this book.<br><i>- William A.

Original.</p><p>Georgia O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s unconventional paintings of mountains, bones, and flowers--often on a giant scale--and her clear, simple forms and colors made her an early pioneer of a new American modernism. The Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Museum opened in summer 1997 in Santa Fe, presenting works from all periods of the artist&#39;s long career. Providing a remarkable virtual tour through the museum, this beautiful clothbound volume with French folded jacket features essays by leading art writers such as Barbara Rose and Mark Stevens, and a new, thorough chronology by Charles Eldredge. Included in the 86 full-color images and 4 lavish gatefolds are many works that have never been reproduced before, which are complemented throughout by black-and-white photographs documenting the extraordinary life of this courageous, inventive artist (1887-1986).

His work, which has won numerous awards, includes Akenfield (now a Penguin 20th Century Classic - it was also made into a feature film by Peter Hall), Private Words, Divine Landscapes, Going to Meet George and numerous other titles. He lives near Colchester.Val Hennessy, Daily Mail &#39;Quite simply, this book is a little masterpiece. It comprises a collection of Blythe&#39;s writings about the Parish year at his Suffolk village of Wormingford. It is written, for the most part, in prose of such sheer beauty that it brings tears to the eyes.&#39; Geoffrey Moorhouse, Daily Telegraph &#39;A series of miniatures, some of no more than three paragraphs, unified in the context of East Anglian countryside and Church of England. Each is perfectly balanced, and aperfect topic in itself for meditation. Lucky are the three Suffolk benefices which enjoy Mr Blythe&#39;s services as Reader, and fortunate therest of us that the author of Akenfield is still producing the most sensitive, the best informed and the most elegant prose devoted wholly to the rural England of our time.&#39; Elisabeth Luard, Saturday Times &#39;Gentle reader, there is a treat in store. A gift of clear wa ter from a deep well. Sweetly, oh so sweetly, do we slip into the poet&#39;s pocket. In Akenfield, the book with which Ronald Blythe made his name, we saw what we once were. In Word From Wormingford, we see what we hope we may still remain.&#39; Robert Runcie, Observer &#39;[Blythe&#39;s] &#34;Words from Wormingford&#34; have been a weekly treat for readers of the Church Times. In the tradition of Gainsborough and Constable, they are landscapes in words, miniature summaries of a week in the life of a village, its churchand its people, against the background of changing seasons (so much more dominant for life in the country than for townsfolk). Now Blythe has collected his work for a wider audience, enriched by the hauntinglyaustere engravings of John Nash, who previously lived in Blythe&#39;s remote farmhouse...Blythe&#39;s prose is full of quiet wit, keen observationsand sober reflection.&#39;</p><h2>Free-Thought on the American Frontier</h2><p>The great majority of historians of American philosophy and intellectual life have concentrated on the East as representative of the whole nation. Yet the West produced its own vibrant culture and outstanding personalities, who embodied the qualities of hardy individualism and devotion to freedom of thought and expression. This remarkable anthology of freethought writing from the American Midwest and West provides a bracing view of a rich and vital democratic culture that has existed on the "American frontier" over the past 150 years.<br><br>Freethought on the American Frontier illustrates the historical roots of contemporary social conflicts in the United States on such vital and timely issues as women's rights, the tension between science and religion, constitutional rights of free speech and free press, and the advancement of humanism in an often hostile environment.<br><br>This important collection of cultural life in America's heartland will prove indispensable to our understanding of the history of the struggle between the forces of repression and Puritanism on the one hand, and those who raised on high the banner of free thought on the other. The issues and ideas generated by this historical conflict continue to play a critical role in our present-day debates on ethics, education, culture, and the very future of the American people.</p><p>YA-- This collection of memoirs, essays, political cartoons, songs, and poetry is an excellent primary source on the social history of the West. Its major focus is on the free-thought movement that was taking place during the 19th century, thus providing a contrast to the movements that were coming out of the East at that time. Essays by such social critics as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mark Twain, Carl Sandburg, and Langston Hughes are included. Populist, Socialist, and labor-related issues are also presented. The book has good illustrations and political cartoons. However, there is no index, and some background information is required.<br><i>- Edward M. Cooley, R . E.

Creation myths are covered first, followed by stories of the old gods (Indra, Agni, and Surya) and some of the greatest goddesses. Holy men who founded the various offshoots of Hinduism are presented, and separate chapters cover Shiv, Vishnu, Ram, and Krishna. There are sections on the Mahabharat and other legends as well. The oversize format and the double-column layout allow a great deal of information to be included. One noticeable omission is a pronunciation guide for the many unfamiliar names. Das' illustrations are well done; the full-color double-page spreads are striking. Smaller black line drawings help break up the large blocks of type. The stories from the myths are the primary attraction here, since they are not readily available in other collections of Indian folklore for children, most of which tend to draw heavily on the Jataka tales. Husain's telling is rather dry, however, and it is unlikely that children will persevere for more than a few pages. Teachers might find that reading a story or two from time to time in a unit on India might be a more fruitful use of the book.

Schindler in 1921-22. Intended as a communal dwelling for the architect and his wife and another couple, and featuring open living spaces and rooftop &#x201c;sleeping baskets&#x201d; suited to the mild Southern California climate, this remarkable home is considered the first modern house to be built in the world. <p>This, the first book on the Schindler House, features new photography&#x2014;specially commissioned color images by Grant Mudford, one of the leading architectural photographers working today&#x2014;as well as many archival shots. Author Kathryn Smith incorporates new research on Schindler as she analyzes every aspect of the house&#x2019;s design and construction and shows why it was such a radical departure from residential architecture that came before&#x2014;and why it is one of the icons of the modern era.</p></p><p>Kathryn Smith, a noted architectural historian, has written and lectured extensively on both Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolph Schindler. She is a founding board member of Friends of the Schindler House, chaired the Schindler Centennial in 1987, and is also the author of Abrams&#39; Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s Taliesin and Taliesin West.In life, avant-garde West Coast architect Rudolf Schindler had his loyal admirers, but he was largely dismissed by prominent tastemakers for perceived transgressions against Modernist design principles. Only long after his death in 1953 have serious efforts gone into assessing his oeuvre. The books reviewed here are welcome additions to the now-burgeoning field of Schindler studies. The Architecture of R.M. Schindler offers five scholarly essays and a wealth of illustrations and photos. Curators Smith and Darling compiled the catalog to accompany a major retrospective put together by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and traveling to Washington, DC, and Vienna, Austria. The text examines the distinct phases of his creative evolution from 1912 until his death but breaks no new ground, except perhaps for disclosures found in recently released personal correspondence detailing the bohemian life Schindler and family led at his west Los Angeles home. It is this landmark 1921 house that is the subject of Schindler House, a happy collaboration between one-time resident Smith (Frank Lloyd Wright: Hollyhock House and Olive Hall) and photographer Mudford. As his own home, Schindler built one of the most startlingly original structures of the 20th century, provoking both fulsome praise and bewildered condemnation. Probing its history and presenting the structure from all angles, this slim volume does more to promote an appreciation of this legendary abode than any prior publication. Schindler House is a most attractive purchase for large public and academic libraries. Comprehensive architecture collections should have The Architecture of R.M. Schindler. For general collections, the most balanced treatment remains David Gebhard's Schindler (William Stout, 1997. reprint). David Solt?sz, Cuyahoga Cty.

Days before the trial, terrible secrets about the O&#39;Riordans&#39; past are revealed to Siobhan, and the family&#39;s only supporter is forced to question her loyalties.

He dined with prime ministers, members of parliament, even kings, as well as with Britain&#x2019;s most esteemed intellectuals&#x2014;including David Hume, Joseph Priestley, and Erasmus Darwin&#x2014;and with more notorious individuals, such as Francis Dashwood and James Boswell. Having spent eighteen formative months in England as a young man, Franklin returned in 1757 as a colonial representative during the Seven Years&#x2019; War, and left abruptly just prior to the outbreak of America&#x2019;s War of Independence, barely escaping his impending arrest. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this fascinating history, George Goodwin gives a colorful account of Franklin&#x2019;s British years.&nbsp; The author offers a rich and revealing portrait of one of the most remarkable figures in U.S. history, effectively disputing the commonly held perception of Franklin as an outsider in British politics.

"A figure out of Talmudic lore-endearing, wise in his crotchets, weary with his wisdom," say<i>s The Washington Post</i>. He loves what he does, but it takes its toll as his commitment to what is right is sorely tested every day on the mean streets of Chicago. As a moral man, he is sometimes faced with some uncomfortable ethical choices in order to see that justice-rather than the letter of the law-is meted out. <br><br>And in <i>Not Quite Kosher</i>, the latest Abe Lieberman mystery by veteran Edgar Award-winning Stuart Kaminsky, our hangdog sleuth is up to his eyeballs in tsurris, the kind of trouble that will drive a man to madness. From tracking a pair of low-rent thieves who stumble into a heist way over their heads to finding out what happened to a man who predicted his own death in a bizarre twist of fate, not to mention planning for a grandson's bar mitzvah that threatens to send him to the poorhouse, Lieberman will do much to find a way to make everything right, even if it takes years off his life.<br><br>And his Irish partner, Bill Hanrahn, the Priest to Lieberman's Rabbi, is in trouble of his own making. For the woman he loves is the object of affection of one of the kingpins of the Asian crime syndicate in Chicago and the notion of this woman marrying anyone from a different culture is anathema.

And at what cost?<br><br>Just another day in the lives of a pair of Chicago's most amiably odd detective team . . . <br></p><p>Chicago policeman Abe Lieberman, beleaguered friend and family man, is vexed with enough tsuris to put him off his blintz- and bagel-impoverished diet. For one thing, there's the confession of a murder that didn't happen made by a man who thinks he's talking to a rabbi when he makes it. Then there's a gang of delinquents who might be responsible for the deaths of a couple of floaters that turn up in Abe's territory. And if that's not enough, Abe's partner, an Irishman engaged to a Chinese woman who's the object of an Asian crime boss's affection, wants him to be best man at his wedding. Throw in a grandson's bar mitzvah that threatens to bankrupt him and an unruly synagogue board, and you've got the ingredients of a typical, warmhearted cozy that won't raise your bubbe's blood pressure but is nonetheless a likable diversion. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Stuart M.

His book Discourse on Colonialism (1950) is a classic of French political literature. Notebook of a Return to My Native Land (1956) is the foundation stone of francophone Black literature: it is here that the word Negritude appeared for the first time. Negritude has come to mean the cultural, philosophical and political movement co-founded in Paris in the 1930s by three Black students from French colonies: the poets Leon-Gontran Damas from French Guiana; Leopold Senghor, later President of Senegal; and Aime Cesaire, who became a deputy in the French National Assembly for the Revolutionary Party of Martinique and was repeatedly elected Mayor of Fort-de-France. Cesaire attended high school and college in France, returning to Martinique during the Second World War. He was mayor of Fort-de-France from 1945 to 2001, except for a break from 1983 to 1984. He helped Martinique shed its colonial status in 1946 to become an overseas departement of France. He was affiliated with the French Communist Party early in his career but became disillusioned in the 1950s and founded the Martinique Progressive Party in 1958. He later allied with the Socialist Party in France&#39;s National Assembly, where he served from 1946 to 1956 and from 1958 to 1993.

A cold, wet wind swept mist in from the dark and restless sea as he made his way along the coast road that defined the small coastal town of Pennywhistle.<br>The multicolored lights at Pennywhistle Park, a tiny amusement center, were shrouded in ghostly haloes. The lights of the park&#x2019;s rides looked, the boy thought, the way a Christmas tree looked when you squinted your eyes, peeking at it one last time before sleepily climbing the stairs on Christmas Eve.<br>Strolling the empty streets, young Nicholas McIver vaguely recognized the town. His mother had a sister who lived in a village that very much resembled this one, but he&#x2019;d visited only once, years earlier, and he was a bit foggy on the details.<br>He did recall that Pennywhistle Park was located on a rocky point sticking out into the sea. It was nearly deserted at this hour, he saw, passing under the lighted entrance. The sun was long down, and the night was growing cold. Most children were home having supper or climbing into their warm beds. Why wasn&#x2019;t he?<br>He couldn&#x2019;t say, really, but here he was.<br>The Ferris wheel, his original destination, came to a creaky stop, and a few strangely silent children climbed out of the cars and rushed into their parents&#x2019; arms, all of them soon disappearing into the mist. Now, it seemed as if he had the entire park to himself. He stepped up to the ticket window. The ticket-taker, with his green eyeshade, looked an awful lot like Nick&#x2019;s best friend in the world, a man named Gunner. A dead-ringer, as his dad would say, down to his full white beard and gold-rimmed glasses!<br>&#x201c;Sorry, son, park&#x2019;s shutting down for the night,&#x201d; the bearded man said when the lad approached, his money tightly clenched in his fist.<br>&#x201c;Are all the rides closed, sir?&#x201d; Nick asked, marveling at the man&#x2019;s voice. He even sounded like Gunner!<br>&#x201c;Well, there is one ride still open, lad. The Whirl-O-Drome.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The spinning airplanes, do you mean? That&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;ve come for, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not just any old airplanes, son, but miniature Spitfires. Supermarines, just like the real thing our boys will be flying when the shooting war with Germany begins. Only without the working engines and machine guns, of course.&#x201d; The man laughed.<br>&#x201c;Which way is the Whirl-O-Drome, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Farthest ride out there. Follow the midway here all the way to the end of the point. See that big flashing red propeller sign spinning round out there? Bit foggy to make out, but there she is, all right. Still catch a ride, looks like, if you hurry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you very much, sir. If I can&#x2019;t ride the Ferris wheel, that looks like a good one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fancy yourself a pilot, do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someday I will be one, sir. My father, you see, was a hero in the Great War. Shot down over the Ardennes, but he took more than a few German Fokkers with him. I plan to sign up with the Royal Flying Corps soon as I&#x2019;m old enough. You can count on that!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good lad. England will need thousands of brave boys like you before this coming war is over. I just heard over the wireless that German armies have marched into Belgium and Holland. And that Chamberlain has resigned, and Churchill is to be Prime Minister.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the pleasure of meeting the great man, sir. And if anyone can bring us safely through this war, it is Winston Churchill.&#x201d;<br>Nick McIver bade the man farewell and followed the darkened midway out to the Whirl-O-Drome. It was very windy and chilly. But he was wearing his father&#x2019;s old leather flying jacket and leather helmet, and both gave him a good deal of warmth.<br>The ride was like a big wheel set on its side, with a slowly revolving beacon light at its hub and eight tiny silver Spitfire airplanes at the end of each spoke. He noticed that all the little planes were empty. As the great wheel turned, the propellers at the nose of each plane spun rapidly in the stiff breeze off the sea.<br>There was a kindly old man in the ticket booth, snow-white hair and big blue eyes, like a baby. He, too, reminded the boy of someone. His grandfather. Yes, he looked exactly like Nick&#x2019;s grandfather! He smiled at Nick. This was indeed the strangest place&#x2014;everyone here reminded him of someone else!<br>&#x201c;Sir, may I have just one ride? I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re closing down for the night, and I don&#x2019;t want to be a bother.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This ride never closes, Nick. I keep it open all the time. Just for young boys like you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But, but, sir, you called me &#x2018;Nick.&#x2019; How on earth do you know my name?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve seen you about, here and there. My name&#x2019;s Captain Orion, but you just call me Cap&#x2019;n. Want to be a pilot someday, don&#x2019;t you, Nick? I&#x2019;ve seen that look in a boy&#x2019;s eyes before, y&#x2019;know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d do anything to become one, sir. My father, whose name is Angus, flew a Sopwith Camel with C Flight, Number 40 Squadron, the very same squadron as Mick Mannock, the famous ace who shot down sixty-one German planes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your dad was an ace, too, before he got shot down by Baron Manfred von Richtofen over the Ardennes forest. Lost the use of one of his legs, I believe. Walks with a cane.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct, sir. The Red Baron ended my father&#x2019;s service to his country. But how on earth did you know about all this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why, Angus McIver is famous, too, Nick. A real hero.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. He&#x2019;d be pleased. Here&#x2019;s my money. I&#x2019;ll take five rides, please.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your money&#x2019;s no good on this ride. Future knights of the air like yerself ride the Whirl-O-Drome for free. Our patriotic duty, y&#x2019;see. Step inside the gate here, and I&#x2019;ll have you airborne before you know it.&#x201d;<br>Cap&#x2019;n Orion brought the spinning ride gradually to a stop, let Nick pick the Spitfire he wanted to fly (they were all identical save the big red numbers painted on the stubby wings) and then helped him climb up inside the bare metal cockpit. He&#x2019;d chosen No. 7, his lucky number. The seat was like a small bucket with leather padding. It had a realistic-looking instrument panel, but when he reached out to touch it, he saw that the dials were all peeling and painted on wood.<br>&#x201c;Does the joystick really work?&#x201d; Nick asked, pulling back on it.<br>&#x201c;Sure does. Pull back to bring her nose up; push forward and she&#x2019;ll go into a dive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about these two pedals?&#x201d; he asked, pushing them with his feet.<br>&#x201c;Your rudder. She&#x2019;ll change course a couple of feet left or right, depending on which pedal you push, Nick. You ready for takeoff, Captain?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let me go crank her up, then.&#x201d;<br>Cap&#x2019;n Orion disappeared back inside the ticket booth, and sure enough, the great wheel began to revolve, round and round. The sea mist made it seem like flying through clouds, and Nick quickly made use of the stick, climbing and diving, using the foot pedals to turn side-to-side.<br>Orion stepped outside to watch the boy.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t this thing go any faster?&#x201d; Nick cried out through cupped hands as he whirled by.<br>The man gave him a thumbs-up and ran back inside the booth. Nick could see him through the window, turning a large wheel mounted on the wall.<br>Suddenly, the little Spitfire was going so fast Nick could hardly believe it. He was amazed the toy airplane didn&#x2019;t just fly right off the end of the long pole. Everything was a blur. He had to pull the old leather goggles down over his eyes because his eyes were tearing up so badly.<br>He looked around. He could no longer see the dark town or Pennywhistle Park or even Cap&#x2019;n Orion inside the ticket booth. It was a little frightening, but Nick supposed he&#x2019;d better get used to real speed if he was ever going to fly a real Spitfire.<br>Then the strangest thing of all happened. The painted-on instruments on the wooden panel began to light up one by one. He leaned forward and looked at them, tapping his finger on the rev counter. The needles were spinning behind real glass! And his altimeter was working! His altitude was six feet. His speed, however, was almost sixty miles per hour and climbing! And now there were tiny red lights flashing out on his wingtips.<br>He heard a strange squawking noise behind the instrument panel and reached up under it to see what it was. There was a hook under there, and on it hung an old pair of headphones, just like the real ones his dad had brought home from the war. There were small ear-holes in his leather flying helmet, and he put the headphones on over it.<br>&#x201c;Captain McIver! Captain McIver! This is Pennywhistle Control. Do you read me? Over.&#x201d;<br>It sounded like Captain Orion, who sounded a lot like his grandfather.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Nick cried, &#x201c;Is everything all right? Is the ride broken? I think it&#x2019;s going too fast!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Roger, Captain, I read you loud and clear. Everything under control. You are cleared for takeoff, skipper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Takeoff?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;See that flashing red button on top of the joystick?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, I do,&#x201d; he said, and suddenly there really was a flashing red button.<br>&#x201c;Just push that button, skipper, and you&#x2019;ll be on your merry way. Happy flying, sir!&#x201d;<br>Push the button? On your way? Happy flying? Being a naturally curious boy, Nick McIver had no choice but to push the red button.

At the height of his fame, he was the artist as royalty: incalculably wealthy, universally idolized�&#x2c6;&#x2019;and wholly isolated.<br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;In this stunning critical assessment, John Berger�&#x2c6;&#x2019;one of this century's most insightful cultural historians�&#x2c6;&#x2019;trains his penetrating gaze upon this most prodigious and enigmatic painter and on the Spanish landscape and very particular culture that shpaed his life and work. Writing with a novelist's sensuous evocation of character and detail, and drawing on an erudition that embraces history, politics, and art, Berger follows Picasso from his childhood in Malaga to the Blue Period and Cubism, from the creation of <i>Guernica</i> to the pained etchings of his final years. He gives us the full measure of Picasso's triumphs and an unsparing reckoning of their cost�&#x2c6;&#x2019;in exile, in loneliness, and in a desolation that drove him, in his last works, into an old man's furious and desperate frenzy at the beauty of what he could no longer create.</p><p>John Berger was born in London in 1926. He is well known for his novels and stories as well as for his works of nonfiction, including several volumes of art criticism. His first novel, <i>A Painter of Our Time</i>, was published in 1958, and since then his books have included <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy <i>Into Their Labours</i>, and the novel <i>G.,</i> which won the Booker Prize in 1972. In 1962 he left Britain permanently, and lived in a small village in the French Alps. He died in 2017.</p><h2>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</h2><p>Trade pbk.; unmarked; no bent or torn pp.; crease to spine; cover, fine</p><p>Just what kind of book is <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>? It <i>contains</i> many things: poems; confessional reveries; disquisitions on the proper way to listen to Beethoven; snippets of dialogue, both real and imagined; a lengthy response to a survey from the <i>Partisan Review</i>; exhaustive catalogs of furniture, clothing, objects, and smells. And then there are Walker Evans's famously stark portraits of depression-era sharecroppers--photographs that both stand apart from and reinforce James Agee's words. <p> Assigned to do a story for <i>Fortune</i> magazine about sharecroppers in the Deep South, Agee and Evans spent four weeks living with a poor white tenant family, winning the Burroughs's trust and immersing themselves in a sharecropper's daily existence. Given a first draft of the resulting article, the editors at <i>Fortune</i> quite understandably threw up their hands--as did several other editors who subsequently worked with a later book-length manuscript. The writing was contrary. It refused to accommodate itself to the reader, and at times it positively bristled with hostility. (What other book could take Marx as the epigraph and then announce: "These words are quoted here to mislead those who will be misled by them"?) Response to the book was puzzled or unfriendly, and <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> sputtered out of print only a few short years after its publication. It took the 1960s, and a vogue for social justice, to bring Agee's masterwork the audience it deserved.</p><p> Yet the book is far more interesting--aesthetically and morally--than the sort of guilty-liberal tract for which it is often mistaken. On an existential level, Agee's text is a deeply felt examination of what it means to suffer, to struggle to live in spite of suffering. On a personal level, it is the painful, beautifully written portrait of one man's obsession. In its collaboration with Evans's photographs, the book is also a groundbreaking experiment in form. In the end, however, it is more than merely the sum of its parts. <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> is, quite simply, a book unlike any other, simmering with anger and beauty and mystery. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>James Agee (1909-1955) was a poet, screenwriter, and journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.<br><br>Walker Evans (1903-1976) is best known for his striking Depression-era photographs. Born in St. Louis, he began his photographic career at twenty-five. He served as an editor for both Fortune and Time and was a professor of graphic arts at Yale.

But when the series debuted in 1994, no one anticipated the sensation it would become. From the first wave of <em>Friends</em> mania to the backlash and renaissance that followed, the show maintained an uncanny connection to its audience, who saw it both as a reflection of their own lives and an aspirational escape from reality. In the years since, <em>Friends</em> has evolved from prime-time megahit to nostalgic novelty, and finally, to certified classic. Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe have entered the pantheon of great television characters, and yet their stories remain relevant still.<br><br><em>I&#x2019;ll Be There for You</em> is a deep dive into <em>Friends</em> history and lore, exploring all aspects of the show, from its unlikely origins to the societal conditions that amplified its success.

Taking readers behind the scenes, Miller traces the cast&#x2019;s rise to fame and untangles the complex relationship between the actors and their characters.

But it underscores Yuri Slezkine's provocative thesis. Not only have Jews adapted better than many other groups to living in the modern world, they have become the premiere symbol and standard of modern life everywhere.</p><br><p> Slezkine argues that the Jews were, in effect, among the world's first free agents. They traditionally belonged to a social and anthropological category known as "service nomads," an outsider group specializing in the delivery of goods and services. Their role, Slezkine argues, was part of a broader division of human labor between what he calls Mercurians-entrepreneurial minorities--and Apollonians--food-producing majorities.</p><br><p> Since the dawning of the Modern Age, Mercurians have taken center stage. In fact, Slezkine argues, modernity is all about Apollonians becoming Mercurians--urban, mobile, literate, articulate, intellectually intricate, physically fastidious, and occupationally flexible. Since no group has been more adept at Mercurianism than the Jews, he contends, these exemplary ancients are now model moderns.</p><br><p> The book concentrates on the drama of the Russian Jews, including �migr�s and their offspring in America, Palestine, and the Soviet Union. But Slezkine has as much to say about the many faces of modernity--nationalism, socialism, capitalism, and liberalism--as he does about Jewry. Marxism and Freudianism, for example, sprang largely from the Jewish predicament, Slezkine notes, and both Soviet Bolshevism and American liberalism were affected in fundamental ways by the Jewish exodus from the Pale of Settlement.</p><br><p> Rich in its insight, sweeping in its chronology, and fearless in its analysis, this sure-to-be-controversial work is an important contribution not only to Jewish and Russian history but to the history of Europe and America as well.</p></p><p><br><p>"Yuri Slezkine has written an extraordinary book with continual surprises.

With a modern fleet of distinctive &#34;silverbirds&#34; serving cities across the United States and overseas, American is a giant in every sense of the word -- in people, equipment and routes. It enters the 21st century bolstered by solid profitability, a far-ranging route network and a long-term agreement with Boeing to keep its fleet updated with the most advanced jetliners. American Eagle, a commuter affiliate grown into a huge airline in its own right, helps extend the company&#39;s reach. So do oneworld and other alliances that permit AA agents to ticket travelers to destinations around the planet. The story of American&#39;s evolution is told in a colorfully illustrated, large-format book with 440 rare photos, classic advertisements and memorabilia on nearly 300 pages. It celebrates the men and women -- pilots, mechanics, dispatchers, flight attendants, agents, ramp workers and managers -- who through the years have defied the odds to make AA not only a survivors, but a leader. As the book explains, today&#39;s success is a far cry from the outlook in the early 1930s. Assembled under the banner of an opportunistic holding company called the Aviation Corporation, American was handicapped by a duke&#39;s mixture of aircraft flying routes that never quite linked up. As losses soared faster than its underpowered flying machines, AA&#39;s very survival seemed in doubt. Happily, the company was blessed with visionary leaders and with dedicated employees who shared their dream of transforming the unwieldy organization into a proud giant. They could see beyond their slow, unreliable flying machines to an era when jetliners would span the oceans. Steadily, they built the company&#39;s reputation for safety and service until it became a model for the industry. Through the imagination, hard work and even heroism of its people, the company survived a Depression, wars, and the turmoil of industry deregulation that doomed many traditional airlines. Tempered by hard times and tough leaders, AA has emerged as one of the most successful, and most competitive, airlines in the world.</p><p></p><h2>The Appeal (Large Print)</h2><p>In a crowded courtroom in Mississippi, a jury returns a shocking verdict against a chemical company accused of dumping toxic waste into a small town&#39;s water supply, causing the worst &#34;cancer cluster&#34; in history.

Farrell clearly defines the 25 different workplace choices that affect women's and men's incomes -- including putting in more hours at work, taking riskier jobs or more hazardous assignments, being willing to change location, and training for technical jobs that involve less people contact -- and provides readers with specific, research-supported ways for women to earn higher pay. <i>Why Men Earn More</i>, with its brashness in the face of political correctness, is sure to ignite a storm of media controversy that will help to make this thoroughly pragmatic expos�&#x17d; Warren Farrell's next bestseller.</p><p>For every dollar earned by men, women earn 76 cents. The exact figure may vary, but such a statistic would seem to bear out the idea of a "pay gap"&#x2014;the idea that women earn substantially less money than men. But if men are paid more than women for the same work, why would anyone ever hire a man? Warren Farrell asked himself that question, and pondered whether the assumption of unequal pay for equal work was really valid. Now, following years of research, he presents his surprising (and perhaps unsettling) answer&#x2014; that women almost always have exactly the same opportunities as men, but make choices that keep them from earning more. <p>Why Men Earn More boldly and methodically debunks traditional assumptions, and investigates the implications of the trade-offs that both men and women make. Pinpointing 25 choices we make in our professional lives, Dr. Farrell unlocks the door to greater earnings and career success&#x2014;as well as to a happier, more balanced life. </p><p>"Once again Warren Farrell has shed light on an important and often misunderstood issue.

Yet, as Norman Ohler&#39;s gripping bestseller reveals, the entire Third Reich was permeated with drugs: cocaine, heroin, morphine and, most of all, methamphetamines, or crystal meth, used by everyone from factory workers to housewives, and crucial to troops&#39; resilience - even partly explaining German victory in 1940. The promiscuous use of drugs at the very highest levels also impaired and confused decision-making, with Hitler and his entourage taking refuge in potentially lethal cocktails of stimulants administered by the physician Dr Morell as the war turned against Germany. While drugs cannot on their own explain the events of the Second World War or its outcome, Ohler shows, they change our understanding of it.

He has also unearthed the way that the German army did not march on its stomach, but on methamphetamine. The supposedly clean-living Nazis, who accused the Jews of corrupting German youth, were the real pushers. The book, written with delightful irony, is an eye-opener. -- Antony Beevor * Guardian * This book transforms the overall picture * Hans Mommsen * Sensational * Daily Mail * Bursting with interesting facts * Vice * Norman Ohler has written an illuminating account of the gobsmacking extent to which military strategy in the Third Reich relied on drugs. ...

Not only part of what came to be known as the Beat generation, Amram has also composed over 100 orchestral and chamber works, written two operas, and has collaborated with such notables as Leonard Bernstein, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Charles Mingus, Dustin Hoffman, Thelonius Monk, Willie Nelson, Betty Carter, Odetta, Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, and Tito Puente. This edition includes a new introduction by the author and a new foreword by Douglas Brinkley</p><p><b>David Amram</b> has composed more than one hundred orchestral and chamber works; written many scores for Broadway theater and film, including the classic scores for the films Splendor in the Grass and The Manchurian Candidate; composed two operas, including the ground-breaking Holocaust opera The Final Ingredient; and composed the score for the landmark 1959 documentary Pull My Daisy, narrated by Jack Kerouac. He is the author of the books <i>Vibrations</i>, an autobiography, <i>Offbeat: Collaborating with Kerouac</i>, and <i> Upbeat: Nine Lives of a Musical Cat.</i>" A pioneer of jazz French horn and World Music, he is also a virtuoso on piano, numerous flutes and whistles, percussion, and dozens of folkloric instruments from twenty-five countries. He is also an inventive, funny improvisational lyricist. He has collaborated with Leonard Bernstein, who chose him as the New York Philharmonic&#x2019;s first composer-in-residence in 1966, Langston Hughes, Dizzy Gillespie, Willie Nelson, Thelonious Monk, Odetta, Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, Charles Mingus, Wynton Marsalis, Lionel Hampton, Johnny Depp, Tito Puente, and many others. Amram&#x2019;s most popular recent works are Giants of the Night, a flute concerto commissioned and premiered by Sir James Galway and dedicated to the memory of Charlie Parker, Jack Kerouac, and Dizzy Gillespie, and Symphonic Variations on a Song by Woody Guthrie. Today, Amram continues to compose music while traveling the world as a conductor, soloist, band leader, visiting scholar, and narrator in five languages. He is currently collaborating with author Frank McCourt on Missa Manhattan, for narrator, chorus, and orchestra, and composing a new piano concerto. All of his concert music is published by C. F. Peters Corporation.&#x201c;Vibrations was a revelation for me. I identified totally with Amram&#x2019;s joie de vivre style, which illuminates the pages of Vibrations. ... One thing is certain: Amram remains the most indefatigable musician of our time.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;From the Foreword by Douglas Brinkley <br> <br>&#x201c;It is a sad book and uproarious, na�ve and knowledgeable, insane and finally as straight as the top of Amram&#x2019;s piano.

There was only one problem--every card was stacked against her. Curveball tells the inspiring story of baseball&#x2019;s female Jackie Robinson,&#x201d; a woman whose ambition, courage, and raw talent propelled her from ragtag teams barnstorming across the Dakotas to playing in front of large crowds at Yankee Stadium. Toni Stone was the first woman to play professional baseball on men&#x2019;s teams.&nbsp; After Robinson integrated the major leagues and other black players slowly began to follow, Stone seized an unprecedented opportunity to play professional baseball in the Negro League. She replaced Hank Aaron as the star infielder for the Indianapolis Clowns and later signed with the legendary Kansas City Monarchs. Playing alongside some of the premier athletes of all time including Ernie Banks, Willie Mays, Buck O&#x2019;Neil, and Satchel Paige, Toni let her talent speak for itself. Curveball chronicles Toni Stone&#x2019;s remarkable career facing down not only fastballs, but jeers, sabotage, and Jim Crow America as well.

Stunning photographs capture the garden's many delights-including the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden, which "displays more than three thousand roses representing all the types of roses grown throughout history," rare blue gentians imported from the Western Caucasus and home-grown pleasures like the spring blossoms on cherry trees.

The aggressive pursuit of heretics and attempts to control the &#x201c;Holy Land&#x201d; might come to mind. Yet the medieval world produced much that is part of our world today, including universities, the passion for Roman architecture and the development of the gothic style, pilgrimage, the emergence of capitalism, and female saints.<br> &nbsp;<br> This new narrative history of medieval Christianity, spanning the period 500 to 1500 CE, attempts to integrate what is familiar to readers with new themes and narratives. Elements of novelty in the book include a steady focus on the role of women in Christianity; the relationships among Christians, Jews, and Muslims; the experience of ordinary parishioners; the adventure of asceticism, devotion, and worship; and instruction through drama, architecture, and art. Madigan expertly integrates these areas of focus with more traditional themes, such as the evolution and decline of papal power; the nature and repression of heresy; sanctity and pilgrimage; the conciliar movement; and the break between the old Western church and its reformers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Illustrated with more than forty photographs of physical remains, this book promises to become an essential guide to a historical era of profound influence.</p><p><b>Kevin Madigan</b> is Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard Divinity School.

Two sets of typefaces -- one for Sara's side, another for Tobey's -- make it easy to track who's talking.</p><p>That Colasanti, a public high school teacher in New York City, gets what high school is like is evident. Film and music references are sprinkled throughout her text, from Sara's favorite movie ("Say Anything") to a band (R.E.M.) she's heard of but never listened to until Tobey. Mentions of drugs, sex, eating disorders and the social pressures teens face aren't overdone, and the dialogue is breezy and realistic (including a few gratuitous f-bombs and a URL to a porn site). Even Colasanti's description about getting dressed for gym is legit: "First I sniff the shirt that's in my locker to make sure it doesn't smell too bad. Even if it does, I still have to wear it. But then I know not to stand too close to anyone." </p><p>Colasanti obviously remembers the kind of love that makes your insides churn, belly flips and all. Her take on young romance is insightful, fresh and fun, her characters fully formed and likable. Knowing how the book will end hardly matters, for When It Happens is sort of like high school itself: The outcome may be predictable, but what's really important is what happens along the way. </p><p>Debra Leithauser, editor of The Post's Sunday Source <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

This new title collects all his work from the original 23 issues of the MAD comic book, including hilarious takes on Superman, Batman, Little Orphan Annie, Flash Gordon, Prince Valiant, Julius Caesar, and movies like The Wild One, The Caine Mutiny and On the Waterfront. <br>Collects stories from MAD #1-23.</p><p>Wallace Wood was born on June 17, 1927 in Menahga, Minnesota. Primarily a self-taught artist, Wood briefly attended both the Minneapolis School of Art and Burne Hogath&#39;s Cartoonists and Illustrators School in New York City (later to become the School of Visual Arts). He entered the comic book field in 1949, freelancing for various publishers including Avon and Ziff-Davis, among others. He is perhaps best known for his work with E.C. in general and their science fiction line in particular. His solid composition and lush inking were perfectly presented in titles like WEIRD SCIENCE and WEIRD FANTASY, which required a constant parade of spaceships, monsters, and luscious women in skintight space suits. Wood also worked on E.C.&#39;s horror and war titles, such as THE VAULT OF HORROR and TWO-FISTED TALES, and at the same time was a regular contributor to MAD. Like Will Elder, Wood was a master of MAD&#39;s &#34;cluttered&#34; sight gags and joke techniques. He continued to contribute to MAD for 12 years, even after its transformation to a black-and-white magazine. In the 1960s and &#39;70s Wood also worked for Marvel and DC, providing pencils and inks for various characters, and broke new ground with his alternative proto-zine Witzend. Suffering from various health problems in his later years, he took his own life on November 3, 1981 in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Living High: An Unconventional Autobiography</h2><p>Courage, gaiety, and a fresh approach to life are reflected in this unconventional autobiography. It is a story of twentieth-century pioneers as resourceful as ever they were in the days of the old frontier. June Burn and her husband Farrar determined to go their own sweet way, enjoying first hand living and not surrendering to the routines of a workaday world. Through the years they had some high and glorious adventures, which included homesteading a gumdrop in the San Juan Islands of the Pacific Northwest, teaching Eskimos near Siberia, and exploring the United States by donkey cart with a baby aboard.</p><p></p><h2>Cold Water</h2><p>Carmel McKisco is wry, volatile and full of longing: a 20-year-old working nights in a dive bar in Manchester, England. Cut off from her family, she forges odd alliances with her customers, daydreams about escaping to Cornwall, her own Elysian Fields, and nurtures mordant fixations on Tony, her charismatic ex, and Steven, her washed-up adolescent hero. As she spins out the days and nights of an unrelenting rainy winter, she finds herself compelled to confront her romantic preoccupations. Peopled with memorable characters and imbued with a subtle sense of raw loneliness beneath the banter and whimsy, this remarkable debut is as cool and assured as Carmel herself. Cold Water was chosen by the Guardian as one of the five outstanding British debut novels of 2002. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t just recommend this book to friends, I&#x2019;d buy it for them.&#x201d;&#x2014;The Guardian &#x201c;[Cold Water] makes you think of Denis Johnson or Anne Tyler ... effortless stylistic sleight of hand and vivid, tactile humanity.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alan Warner, author of The Sopranos &#x201c;Gwendoline Riley is only twenty-two, but her short, sharp prose sets her book apart from other coming-of-age novels.&#x201d;</p><p>"These days I try to keep everything remote as a matter of course. Just feel the warm rush of things washing over." Whimsical 20-year-old British barmaid Carmel McKisco wanders from one tenuous relationship and fleeting flirtation to another in Riley's first novel, about blue-collar life in Manchester and London. Carmel's wistful voice is punctuated by occasional bursts of wry humor, and it effectively carries the first half of the book as the narrator describes her on-again, off-again relationship with slippery charmer Tony. Carmel also muses on her passing attraction to a bar patron named Kevin Kinsella, as well as a hero from her adolescence who reappears in her orbit, a washed-up singer named Steven whose life has come to a dead end. The thinly plotted book loses narrative momentum, however, in its second half, meandering toward a predictable conclusion. Carmel's loneliness and her poignant-but never maudlin-dreams of a comfortable, fulfilling life are well rendered, and this might have been an intriguing novel if Riley had used those desires as a vehicle for a more substantial plot. As it is, the book has much in common with other belated-coming-of-age tales about twentysomethings adrift. Riley's obvious talent for characterization doesn't quite compensate for the familiar material, though it does make her one to watch in the future.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shelter Dogs</h2><p>In this book, photographer Traer Scott presents over fifty endearing and frequently heartrending portraits of shelter dogs. These images capture the genuine spirit of dogs of all ages, sizes, breeds, and temperaments, whether playful, proud, inquisitive, or shy. Above all, these photographs reveal the strikingly intense emotion, dignity, and even humor that Scott saw in each face, despite the dog&#39;s circumstances. By documenting the soulful, unique characters of just a few of the hundreds of dogs she has encountered in her volunteer work, Scott raises awareness of animal rescue and welfare causes, and particularly the need for more adoptive homes for abandoned animals. This collection of portraits is a tribute to all dogs and will appeal to animal lovers every where.</p><p>Traer Scott, a fine art photographer with a background in portraiture and fashion, was raised as an only child in a house full of animals. A menagerie of cats, wounded wild animals, birds, snakes and dogs were her most constant childhood companions.

She lives in Corinth, Vermont.As readers quickly comprehend, building a house is a complex project requiring the cooperative efforts of many people. With her usual skill, Gibbons makes the process easy to understand. Beginning with the architect who draws the plans, readers meet the surveyors, equipment operators, carpenters, plumbers, and other people who produce a building. The book concludes with a family moving in, ready to make the house a home. Although children in some parts of the country will not relate specifically to houses with basements or septic systems, How a House Is Built provides basic, general information without oversimplifying. The illustrations are typical of Gibbons' style: bright colors, clean lines, and captions where necessary to define unfamiliar terms. Women are well represented in many non-traditional roles but not much racial diversity is shown. An appended page encourages comparison of modern frame houses to simple houses of the past.

Reprint.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple if shocking question, and former librarian Aurora Teagarden is just the person to find the answer. Basking in an inheritance that makes her financially independent, Roe&#39;s looking for a new occupation. Her days as a librarian are over. Real estate might be fun, she thinks. And who better to teach her the tricks of the trade than her Lauren Bacall look-alike mother, Aida Brattle Teagarden Queensland, who happens to own one of the major real estate firms in town? Signing on as an apprentice, Roe agrees to show an expensive house to some out-of-town clients. The house has its charms, but the clients are not too thrilled with what&#39;s been left behind in the master bedroom: the corpse of real estate woman Tonia Lee Greenhouse. And Tonia&#39;s only the first victim. It quickly becomes clear that the killer is someone familiar with the real estate community in Lawrenceton, someone who has access to the houses that are on the market. Roe&#39;s not too sure she likes real estate, after all. She hadn&#39;t counted on murder. But she definitely likes her well-to-do client, Martin Bartell. In fact, it may be love at first sight.

After reading a book on Buddhism she realized that this was what she had been seeking and left England for India at the age of twenty.</p><p>After considerable searching she entered a monastery. The only woman among hundreds of men, she grew determined to break down the prejudices that had excluded women from the path to enlightenment for thousands of years. She left after six years, set on attaining enlightenment in the body of a woman; a totally radical objective. She decided to seclude herself in a remote cave, 12,00 feet up in the Himalayas. For twelve years she faced unimaginable cold, wild animals, floods and rockfalls, grew her own food and slept in a traditional wooden meditation box, three feet square---she never lay down.</p><p>In 1988 she emerged from the cave determined to build a convent in northern India, and to revive the Togdenma lineage, a long-forgotten female spiritual elite. From living as a mendicant of $80 a year, she became a globe-trotting fundraiser. Tenzin Palmo has agreed to tell her story only to Vicki Mackenzie.</p></p><p>It sounds like a legend out of medieval Tibet: the ascetic who leaves home to join the Buddhist order, then spends 12 years in a cave, 15 hours a day in a meditation box. This is no legend, but you could call Tenzin Palmo legendary in her single-minded pursuit of higher realizations. From the East End of London to halfway up the Himalayas, she is now back in society, attempting to pull medieval Tibetan Buddhism into the modern era--women's rights and all. As biographer Vickie Mackenzie says by way of background, a group of elite women practitioners called "Togdemnas" still existed just decades ago. Tenzin Palmo, having studied with her male counterparts, is now canvassing the planet, welcoming women into full participation in Tibetan Buddhism and building support for an academy of Togdemnas that she plans to establish in the Himalayas. Mackenzie helps raise awareness for women's roles in Tibetan Buddhism by going into some detail about obstacles still faced by women as well as heroines who have overcome those obstacles, such as Yeshe Tsogyel (Sky Dancer) and Machig Lapdron, a mother who started her own lineage. If Mackenzie has it her way, it won't be long before Tenzin Palmo joins that list of heroines. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>&#34;In 1976 Diane Perry, by then known by her Tibetan name, Tenzin Palmo, secluded herself in a remote cave, 13,200 feet up in the Himalayas, cut off from the world by mountains and snow. There she engaged in twelve years of intense Buddhist meditation. She faced unimaginable cold, wild animals, near-starvation and avalanches; she grew her own food and slept in a traditional wooden meditation box, three-foot square - she never lay down. Her goal was to attain enlightenment as a woman.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>The King and I: The Uncensored Tale of Luciano Pavarotti&#39;s Rise to Fame by His Manager, Friend and Sometime Adversary</h2><p><p><b>Luciano Pavarotti&#x2019;s longtime manager and friend tells all. <i>All</i>.<br></b><br><i>The King and I</i> is the story of the thirty-six-year-old business relationship between Luciano Pavarotti and his manager, Herbert Breslin, during which Breslin guided what he calls, justifiably, &#x201c;the greatest career in classical music.&#x201d; During that career, Breslin moved Pavarotti out of the opera house and onto the concert (and the world) stage and into the arms of a huge mass public. How he and Pavarotti changed the landscape of opera is one of the most significant and entertaining stories in the history of classical music, and Herbert Breslin relates the tale in a brash, candid, witty fashion that is often bitingly frank and profane. He also provides a portrait of his friend and client&#x2014;&#x201c;a beautiful, simple, lovely guy who turned into a very determined, aggressive, and somewhat unhappy superstar&#x201d;&#x2014;that is by turns affectionate and satirical and full of hilarious details and tales out of school, with Pavarotti emerging as something like the ultimate Italian male. The book is also enlivened by the voices of other players in the soap opera drama that was Pavarotti&#x2019;s career, and they are no less uncensored than Herbert Breslin. The last word, in fact, comes from none other than Luciano Pavarotti himself!<br><i>The King and I</i> is the ultimate backstage book about the greatest opera star of the past century&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a delight to read as well.</p></p><p><p><b>Herbert Breslin</b> has been a classical music publicist and manager for many of the greatest performers of our time for the past forty years.<br><br><b>Anne Midgette</b> is a regular reviewer of classical music for the <i>New York Times</i> and has contributed to <i>Opera News</i> and many other music magazines.</p>Chapter I<br>FROM CHRYSLER TO CARNEGIE HALL<br>Midlife Crisis: My Start in the Business<br>Here's how not to begin your brilliant professional career. In 1957, I was thirty-three years old. I was married, with a child on the way. And I was working as a speechwriter for the Chrysler Corporation. In Detroit, Michigan.<br><br>Detroit, Michigan. Who would even want to think about it? Misery.<br><br>People suppose that to succeed in the classical music business you should be very highly directed. You should have experience as a performer, so you know what it's like on the other side of the footlights. You should get your foot in the door early and work in a number of different areas so you get to know all sides of the performing arts. Ultimately, you'll gather the experience you need to set up your own company and manage top-level artists.<br><br>Well, that's all bullshit.<br><br>I came out of nowhere. I was smart. I was full of energy. And I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. All I knew was that I loved music.<br><br>How much did I love music? I'd been obsessed with opera since I was eight years old. The beauty, the glamour, the excitement, and the tremendous voices pulled me into another world. I had a huge collection of records I listened to constantly. I had scrapbooks of the performances I'd seen and the artists I loved. Whatever else was going on around me, opera served as my own private support system and gave me tremendous sustenance. So much sustenance, in fact, that it became my life.<br><br>The problem I had when I was thirty-three was that it had nothing to do with my life. Especially not my life in Detroit. There's a little bit of music in Detroit, but nothing you would really want to seriously consider. I'm a New Yorker. I was starved for opera. I would get the <i>New York Time</i>s and wistfully scan the cast lists at the Metropolitan Opera, which the <i>Times</i> used to print every Monday, for the two weeks ahead.<br><br>One week I saw that Renata Tebaldi was scheduled to sing Tosca, and I couldn't help myself. Tebaldi was one of the greatest sopranos singing. People portrayed her as a rival of Maria Callas: Tebaldi's pure vocal beauty against Callas's dramatic brilliance. Myself, I liked Callas fine, but I was a fierce fan of Renata Tebaldi. Intoxicating things happened when the woman opened her mouth. It was enough to make you fly to New York. I said to my wife, Carol, "We're going to see that <i>Tosca</i>," and I bought tickets.<br><br>Carol is a New Yorker, too, so she was game for a weekend in the city. She herself was prone to making dramatic pronouncements that she didn't want our first child to be born in Detroit. She was no happier living there than I was. She didn't completely share my passion for opera, but she was certainly happy to go, especially to see a performance as great as I promised her this one was going to be. By the time we walked into the old Met on Thirty-ninth Street, I was beside myself with excitement.<br><br>Imagine my feelings when I saw a notice in the lobby announcing that Madame Tebaldi was indisposed. Tosca would be sung by Antoinette Stella.<br><br>I went cold with disappointment. By today's standards, Antoinette Stella is nothing to sneeze at; but I hadn't flown in all the way from Detroit to hear Antoinette Stella sing Tosca. I couldn't believe my plans had been thwarted so cruelly, and I didn't want to accept it. I completely lost my temper. I said, "I do not want to hear this performance."<br><br>Opera houses, of course, don't refund a patron's ticket money if an artist cancels. Cancelations are practically part of opera routine. A singer's instrument--as any singer will be the first to tell you, and the second to tell you, and the last to tell you, so often do they reiterate it--is extremely fragile. A mild cold, a touch of allergies, a dry hotel room: any one of these things, and a thousand more, can keep them offstage. If opera houses refunded ticket money every time a big singer got sick, they'd all be even more broke than they already are.<br><br>I knew this, or some of this, at the time, but I didn't care. I let the box office know it. I said, "I do not want to hear anybody else. I do not want to have anything to do with this performance. I want my money back."<br><br>"We can't give you your money back," said the man at the box office window.<br><br>"I want my money back!" I said. By this point, I was raving like a banshee. Nobody knew what to do with me. My wife was standing by, looking a little bewildered at my behavior.<br><br>I made such a stink that they finally summoned Francis Robinson, who was the head of the box office in those days, to come out and deal with me. Francis was a lovely guy and extremely knowledgeable about all things operatic; he wrote a lot about the opera, and he ran the Met's public relations department. But I barely knew who he was that night, and he sure as hell didn't know who I was. I wasn't even in the music business. I was just some crank from Detroit making a ruckus in the lobby.<br><br>"How can I help you?" said Francis.<br><br>I said, "Mr. Robinson, I am not as insane as I may sound, but the fact of the matter is that I came in from Detroit to hear Madame Tebaldi, and I was looking forward to it so much. I know that she's sick. But I do not want to go and listen to this."<br><br>"Well," Francis said with a smile, "unfortunately there's not much we can do to bring Madame Tebaldi to tonight's performance. Listen. Go to the performance now, and we'll see about getting you a pair of tickets to Madame Tebaldi's next appearance."<br><br>He did, too. He was a lovely guy.<br><br>Later in my life, I always remembered that incident whenever fans got upset at a Luciano Pavarotti cancelation. You come all that way for something you're really excited to see, and then your hopes are dashed. It's like having the rug pulled out from under you. I knew exactly how they felt.<br><br>Not that I ever gave any of them a free pair of tickets as compensation. I'd be in the poorhouse.<br><br>Little did I know that night at the Met that within a few years I would be Renata Tebaldi's press agent. I might have felt better.<br><br>As I said, I was hooked on opera from childhood--from the day my father took me to see <i>Carmen</i> at the New York Hippodrome, on Sixth Avenue at Forty-fourth Street. I don't know exactly why he took me; it wasn't as if we went to performances all the time. We were not people of great means. But he did love music. And <i>Carmen</i>, with its rousing tunes and gripping drama, was a great first opera. My father couldn't have suspected what he had started.<br><br>By the time I was a teenager, every spare penny I had was going for opera. From our home in the Bronx, I'd take the subway down to Manhattan and wait on the line for standing-room tickets. There was a real camaraderie on that line in those days. My friend Myron Egan, who was killed in the war, and I went together and saw everything and everybody that we could. After the show, we'd wait for the artists to come out and get their autographs. And what artists. In those days, it was the ladies who ruled opera: we went to hear the sopranos. Grace Moore, the glamorous American soprano, killed in a plane crash at age forty-eight: I heard her debut as Tosca. Zinka Milanov, the Yugoslavian who looked like a potato and sang like a goddess: somewhere I still have a picture that she autographed for me sixty years ago.<br><br>I fantasized about being a singer myself. But since I didn't have a lot of financial resources, I also had to pay close attention to what was practical. To help pay for all of my opera activity, I occasionally took a job in opera itself--as a supernumerary in the big operas, like <i>Aida</i>, that call for a lot of warm bodies onstage. In those days, you got paid something like two dollars for being a super. I got a little extra, because I always tried to take home a piece of my costume as a souvenir. I soon added a wig, a helmet, and a number of other items to my collection of opera memorabilia. I saw myself as a self-supporter, which was something that turned out to be very useful to me.<br><br>When I look back, all the dates in my life are marked by the music I heard. Well, nearly all. When I first went into the army in 1943, I was stationed in Nebraska, and there was no music there at all. My job was to guard the German and Italian POWs as they worked in the fields. My great contribution to the war effort was overseeing the harvest of the sugar beet crop in western Nebraska. The Italians were very lazy; you had to push them to get the work done. Come to think of it, this first exposure to the Italian mentality may have stood me in good stead in my professional life.<br><br>Later in the war, I did get music. In 1944, I was transferred to Camp Crowder, Missouri, and I went to Joplin, Missouri, to hear a recital by a wonderful soprano named Miliza Korjus, a lovely looking woman, if a little zaftig, who had starred in the film <i>The Great Waltz</i>, about Johann Strauss. It should have been called <i>The Great Schmaltz</i>, but she sang well. She could venture into a stratospheric range to which few singers could aspire.<br><br>In 1945, I went to Europe as a cryptographer with the army signal corps, following right behind Eisenhower. Army HQ was in Reims, France, and I took a day trip to Paris and went to the Opera Comique, where I heard Puccini's <i>Madama Butterfly</i> with a soprano named Jeanne Segala. Eisenhower moved on to Frankfurt, where all the theaters were bombed out; they were putting on opera performances in the basement of the Barsensaal, the stock exchange, and I attended a Tosca and Mozart's <i>Nozze di Figaro</i> down there. On my furlough, I went to Rome, where at the Teatro Reale I heard Maria Caniglia, the soaring Italian soprano, in Verdi's <i>La Traviata</i>. I adored Europe. I even found a voice teacher in Reims named Madame Patou, who gave me lessons once or twice a week in exchange for money, as well as coffee and sugar and other things I br...</p><h2>The Web of Debt</h2><p>EXPLODING THE MYTHS ABOUT MONEY. Our money system is not what we have been led to believe. The creation of money has been privatized, or taken over by a private money cartel. Except for coins, all of our money is now created as loans advanced by private banking institutions -- including the private Federal Reserve. Banks create the principal but not the interest to service their loans. To find the interest, new loans must continually be taken out, expanding the money supply, inflating prices -- and robbing you of the value of your money. Web of Debt unravels the deception and presents a crystal clear picture of the financial abyss towards which we are heading. Then it explores a workable alternative, one that was tested in colonial America and is grounded in the best of American economic thought, including the writings of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. If you care about financial security, your own or the nation&#39;s, you should read this book.</p><p>Ellen Brown has applied her training as a litigating attorney, researcher and writer to the monetary field, unearthing facts that even the majority of banking and financial experts ignore: ranging from the privatization of money creation, to the Plunge Protection Team, to the Federal Reserve's "Helicopter Money." Read it; you'll get information you need in order to understand what is going on in our financial markets today. <br>- Bernard Lietaer, former European central banker, author of "The Future of Money" and "Of Human Wealth" <p> Literacy on the topic of money is at an all-time low. This book is tremendously important not only in its presentation, but by drawing attention to an age-old topic that should have a major presence in the public mind. <br>- Benjamin Gisin, Author of "Farmers and Ranchers Guide to Credit," publisher of "Touch the Soil" magazine, and a senior loan officer for a top 10 bank</p>Ellen Brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles. In Web of Debt, her latest book, she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and the money trust. She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves, and how we the people can get it back. Brown developed an interest in the developing world and its problems while living abroad for eleven years in Kenya, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. She returned to practicing law when she was asked to join the legal team of a popular Tijuana healer with an innovative cancer therapy, who was targeted by the chemotherapy industry in the 1990s. That experience produced her book Forbidden Medicine, which traces the suppression of natural health treatments to the same corrupting influences that have captured the money system. Brown&#39;s eleven books include the bestselling Nature&#39;s Pharmacy, co-authored with Dr. Lynne Walker, which has sold 285,000 copies.</p><h2>All passion spent (Virago omnibus)</h2><p>Echoing the themes in A Room of One&#39;s Own by her great friend Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West remaps the destiny of the gentle, gracious eighty-eight-year-old Lady Slane in this classic modern novel. Having surrendered seven decades of her life to the exemplary, if often hollow fulfillment of her marriage, to the expectations of her statesman husband and the demands of her children, Lady Slane finally, in her widowhood, defies her family. She dismisses the wishes and plans of her six pompous sons and daughters for her future, and instead retires to a tiny house in Hampstead, where she chooses to live independently and free from her past. There she alters, and not without some success, the course of her personal history. There, too, she recollects the dreams of her youth and at last, with one last &#34;strange and lovely thing,&#34; acts upon the passion she forfeited seventy years earlier to the narrow conventions of a proper Victorian marriage. &#34;...Sackville-West has borrowed in her prose writing some ... function of poetry, the ability to suggest far more than she says.&#34; New York Times &#34;Witty and charming and graceful and brilliant.</p><p>Vita Sackville-West (1892-1962) was born and educated at Knole. She and her husband Harold Nicolson created the famous garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent.Henry Lyulph Holland, first Earl of Slane, had existed for so long that the public had begun to regard him as immortal. The public, as a whole, finds reassurance in longevity, and, after the necessary interlude of reaction, is disposed to recognise extreme old age as a sign of excellence. The long-liver has triumphed over at least one of man&#x2019;s initial handicaps: the brevity of life. To filch twenty years from eternal annihilation is to impose one&#x2019;s superiority on an allotted programme. So small is the scale upon which we arrange our values. It was thus with a start of real incredulity that City men, opening their papers in the train on a warm May morning, read that Lord Slane, at the age of ninety-four, had passed away suddenly after dinner on the previous evening. &#x2018;Heart failure,&#x2019; they said sagaciously, though they were actually quoting from the papers; and then added with a sigh, &#x2018;Well, another old landmark gone.&#x2019; That was the dominant feeling: another old landmark gone, another reminder of insecurity. All the events and progressions of Henry Holland&#x2019;s life were gathered up and recorded in a final burst of publicity by the papers; they were gathered together into a handful as hard as a cricket-ball, and flung in the faces of the public, from the days of his &#x2018;brilliant university career,&#x2019; through the days when Mr Holland, at an astonishingly early age, had occupied a seat in the Cabinet, to this very last day when as Earl of Slane, K.G., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. etc. &#x2013; his diminishing honours trailing away behind him like the tail of a comet &#x2013; he had drooped in his chair after dinner, and the accumulation of ninety years had receded abruptly into history. Time seemed to have made a little jump forward, now that the figure of old Slane was no longer there with outstretched arms to dam it back. For some fifteen years he had taken no very active part in public life, but he had been there, and on occasion the irrefutable suavity, common sense, and mockery of his eloquence in Parliament had disturbed, though it could not actually arrest, his more extreme colleagues upon the brink of folly. Such pronouncements had been rare, for Henry Holland had always been a man to appreciate the value of economy, but by their very rarity they produced a wholesome sense of uneasiness, since men knew them to be backed up by a legend of experience: if the old man, the octogenarian, the nonagenarian, could bestir himself to the extent of stalking down to Westminster and unburdening himself, in his incomparable way, of opinions carefully, soberly, but cynically gestated, then the Press and the public were compelled into attention. Nobody had ever seriously attacked Lord Slane. Nobody had ever accused Lord Slane of being a back-number. His humour, his charm, his languor, and his good sense, had rendered him sacrosanct to all generations and to all parties; of him alone among statesmen and politicians, perhaps, could that be said. Perhaps, because he seemed to have touched life on every side, and yet never seemed to have touched life, the common life, at all, by virtue of his proverbial detachment, he had never drawn upon himself the execration and mistrust commonly accorded to the mere expert. Hedonist, humanist, sportsman, philosopher, scholar, charmer, wit; one of those rare Englishmen whose fortune it is to be born equipped with a truly adult mind. His colleagues and his subordinates had been alternately delighted and infuriated by his assumed reluctance to deal with any practical question. It was difficult to get a yes or a no out of the man. The more important a question was, the more flippantly he dealt with it. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he would write at the bottom of a memorandum setting forth the advantages of two opposite lines of policy; and his myrmidons passed their hands over their brows, distraught. He was destroyed as a statesman, they said, because he always saw both sides of the case; but even as they said it with exasperation, they did not mean it, for they knew that on occasion, when finally pushed into a corner, he would be more incisive, more deadly, than any man seated four-square and full of importance at a governmental desk. He could cast his eye over a report, and pick out its heart and its weakness before another man had had time to read it through. In his exquisitely courteous way, he would annihilate alike the optimism and the myopia of his correspondent. Courteous always, and civilised, he left his competitors dead.<br><br>&nbsp;His personal idiosyncrasies, too, were dear to the public as to the caricaturists; his black satin stock, his eyeglass swung on an extravagantly wide ribbon, the coral buttons to his evening waistcoat, the private hansom he maintained long after motors had come into fashion &#x2013; by all this was he buttressed through the confused justice and injustice of legend; and when, at the age of eighty-five, he finally succeeded in winning the Derby, no man ever received a greater ovation. His wife alone suspected how closely those idiosyncrasies were associated with a settled policy. The least cynical of people by nature, she had learned to lay a veneer of cynicism over herself after seventy years&#x2019; association with Henry Holland. &#x2018;Dear old man,&#x2019; said the City men in the train; &#x2018;well, he&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;<br><br>He was gone indeed, very finally and irretrievably gone. So thought his widow, looking down at him as he lay on his bed in Elm Park Gardens. The blinds were not lowered, for he had always stipulated that when he came to die the house should not be darkened, and even after his death nobody would have dreamed of disobeying his orders. He lay there in the full sunlight, sparing the stone-mason the trouble of carving his effigy. His favourite great-grandchild, to whom everything was permitted, had often twitted him, saying that he would make a handsome corpse; and now that the joke had become a reality, the reality gained in impressiveness for having been anticipated by a joke. His was the type of face which, even in life, one associates prophetically with the high dignity of death. The bony architecture of nose, chin, and temples, stood out in greater relief for the slight sinking of the flesh; the lips took a firmer line, and a lifetime of wisdom lay sealed behind them. Moreover, and most importantly, Lord Slane looked as soign� in death as he had looked in life. &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; you would say, even though the bedclothes covered him, &#x2018;is a dandy.&#x2019;<br><br>Yet, for all its dignity, death brought a revelation. The face which had been so noble in life lost a trifle of its nobility in death; the lips which had been too humorous to be unpleasantly sardonic now betrayed their thinness; the carefully concealed ambition now revealed itself fully in the proud curve of the nostril. The hardness which had disguised itself under the charming manner now remained alone, robbed of the protection of a smile. He was beautiful, but he was less agreeable. Alone in the room his widow contemplated him, filled with thoughts that would greatly have surprised her children, could they but have read her mind.<br><br>Her children, however, were not there to observe her. They were collected in the drawing-room, all six of them; two wives and a husband bringing the number up to nine. A sufficiently formidable family gathering &#x2013; old, black ravens, thought Edith, the youngest, who was always flustered and always trying to confine things into the shape of a phrase, like pouring water into a ewer, but great gouts of meaning and implication invariably ran over and slopped about and were lost. To attempt to recapture them after they had spilt was as hopeless as trying to hold the water in your hand. Perhaps, if one had a notebook and pencil always ready &#x2013; but then the thought would be lost while one was looking for the right word; and, moreover, it would be difficult to use a notebook without everybody seeing. Shorthand? &#x2013; but one must not let one&#x2019;s thoughts run on like this; one must discipline one&#x2019;s mind, keeping one&#x2019;s attention on the present matter, as other people seemed to do without any difficulty; though, to be sure, if one had not learnt that lesson by the time one was sixty, one was never likely to learn it. A formidable family gathering, thought Edith, coming back: Herbert, Carrie, Charles, William, and Kay; Mabel, Lavinia; Roland. They went in groups: the Hollands themselves, the sisters-in-law, the brother-in-law; then they sorted themselves differently: Herbert and Mabel, Carrie and Roland; Charles; William and Lavinia; and then Kay all by himself. It was not often that they all met together, none missing &#x2013; curious, Edith thought, that Death should be the convener, as though all the living rushed instantly together for protection and mutual support. Dear me, how old we all are. Herbert must be sixty-eight, and I&#x2019;m sixty; and Father was over ninety, and Mother is eighty-eight. Edith, who had begun making a sum of their total ages, surprised them all very much by asking, &#x2018;How old are you, Lavinia?&#x2019; Thus taken aback, they rebuked Edith by their stare; but that was Edith all over, she never listened to what was being said, and then suddenly came out with some irrelevant remark. Edith could have told them that all her life she had been trying to say what she meant, and had never yet succeeded. Only too often, she said something precisely the opposite of what she wanted to say. Her terror was that she should one day use an indecent word by mistake. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it splendid that Father is dead,&#x2019; she might say, instead of, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it terrible&#x2019;; and there were other possibilities, even more appalling, by which one might use a really dreadful word,&nbsp; the sort of word that butcher-boys scrawled in pencil on the white-washed walls of the basement passage, and about which one had to speak, most evasively, to the cook. An unpleasant task; the sort of task that fell to Edith in Elm Park Gardens and to a thousand Ediths all over London. But of these preoccupations her family knew nothing.<br><br>They were gratified now to see that she blushed, and that her hands went up nervously to fiddle with the grey strands of her hair; the gesture implied that she had not spoken. Having reduced her to this confusion, they returned to their conversation, suitably hushed and mournful. Even the voices of Herbert and Carrie, habitually insistent, were lowered. Their father lay upstairs, and their mother was with him.<br><br>&#x2018;Mother is wonderful.&#x2019;<br><br>Over and over, thought Edith, they had reiterated that phrase. Surprise was in their accents, as though they had expected their mother to rant, rave, scream, give herself up for lost. Edith knew very well that her brothers and sister privately entertained a theory that their mother was rather a simpleton. From time to time she let fall remarks that could not be reconciled with ordinary sense; she had no grasp on the world as it was; she was apt to say impetuous things which, although uttered in English, made no more sense than had they been uttered in an outer-planetary language. Mother was a changeling, they had often said politely, in the bitter-sweet accents reserved for a family joke; but now in this emergency they found a new phrase: Mother is wonderful. It was the thing they were expected to say, so they said it, several times over, like a refrain coming periodically into their conversation and sweeping it upwards on to a higher level. Then it drooped again; became practical. Mother was wonderful, but what was to be done with Mother? Evidently, she could not go on being wonderful for the rest of her life. Somewhere, somehow, she must be allowed to break down, and then, after that was over, must be stowed away; housed, taken care of. Outside, in the streets, the posters might flare: death of Lord Slane. The journalists might run up and down Fleet Street assembling their copy; they might pounce on the pigeon-holes &#x2013; that macabre columbarium &#x2013; where the obituary notices were stored in readiness; they might raid each other&#x2019;s information: &#x2018;I say, is it true that old Slane always carried his cash in coppers? wore cr�pe soles? dipped his bread in his coffee?&#x2019; Anything to make a good paragraph. Telegraph-boys might ring the bell, propping their red bicycles against the kerb, delivering their brown messages of condolence, from all over the world, from all parts of the Empire, especially where Lord Slane had served his term of government. Florists might deliver their wreaths &#x2013; already the narrow hall was full of them &#x2013; &#x2018;indecently soon,&#x2019; said Herbert, peering jealously nevertheless at the attached cards through his monocle. Old friends might call &#x2013; &#x2018;Herbert &#x2013; so dreadfully sudden &#x2013; of course, I didn&#x2019;t expect to see your dear Mother&#x2014;&#x2019; But obviously they had expected it, had expected to be the sole exception, and Herbert must turn them away, rather enjoying it: &#x2018;Mother, you understand, is naturally rather overcome; wonderful, I must say; but just at present, you&#x2019;ll understand, I&#x2019;m sure, is seeing nobody but Us&#x2019;; and so with many pressings of Herbert&#x2019;s hand they took their departure, having got no further than the hall or the doorstep. Reporters might loiter on the pavement, dangling cameras like black concertinas. All this might go on outside the house, but inside it, upstairs, Mother was with Father and the problem of her future lay heavy upon her sons and daughters.</p><h2>Gun Digest Shooter&#39;s Guide To Reloading</h2><p>Drawing from decades of experience, author and ballistics expert Philip Massaro provides detailed instructions to help you successfully reload your own rifle and pistol ammunition.

Included are a useful chronology of the artist's life and a wonderful series of photographs of the artist in his studio and at work on these canvases. Yet the reproductions of the paintings themselves form the core of the volume, and they are sumptuous. The volume itself is oversize and includes numerous fold-out pages, giving a sense of the paintings' size and rendering them to scale. The effect is overwhelming.

Or is the truth about her weirder and infinitely more dangerous? <b>The Dain Curse</b> is one of the Continental Op's most bizarre cases, and a tautly crafted masterpiece of suspense.</p><p>Everything about the Leggett diamond heist indicated to the Continental Op that it was an inside job. From the stray diamond found in the yard to the eyewitness accounts of a &#34;strange man&#34; casing the house, everything was just too pat. Gabrielle Dain-Leggett has enough secrets to fill a closet, and when she disappears shortly after the robbery, she becomes the Op&#39;s prime suspect. But her father, Edgar Leggett, keeps some strange company himself and has a dark side the moon would envy.

Sometimes these products lack the scientific evidence to support their alleged health benefits and are no more than fads. This is a shame. Marketing hype aside, there is hard scientific research to show that some foods contain exceptional levels of nutrients that promote good health and protect the human body against disease. These are the super foods I have focused on in this book.<br> Finding a standard measure of what constitutes a super food is, however, complicated. A number of rating systems have been developed around the world that rank foods according to their nutrient density&#x2014;the measure of nutrients per calorie. The problem is that these systems are not consistent. For example, some use different sets of essential nutrients as the basis for the rating. What&#x2019;s more, nutrient density is not the only important factor. For example, there are thousands of phytochemicals that appear to have the potential to protect against a range of diseases, but these are not included in nutrient density measures because they have not been established as essential for bodily function.&nbsp;<br> After researching various rating systems, I have devised my own list of powerhouse foods (see pages 10 to 16) that contain exceptionally high levels of vitamins, phytochemicals, and other nutrients that are strongly associated with good health and reduced risk of chronic disease. The super foods that appear on this list are set in boldface in each recipe&#x2019;s ingredients list so that they can be identified easily. Some ingredients found in the recipes&#x2014;such as nut milks, wakame, tahini, and miso&#x2014;are also set in boldface because they are forms <br> of super foods.&nbsp;<br> The list is by no means exhaustive, but provides a cross-section of super foods <br> in different food groups to help you load your diet with as much goodness <br> as possible.</p><h2>Island of Glass (The Guardians Trilogy)</h2><p>Continuing the hunt for the Star of Ice in Ireland, the immortal Doyle confronts his tragic past while the archaeologist Riley immerses herself in local history and finds herself targeted by a dark goddess.</p><p><b>Nora Roberts </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than 200 novels.

An immortal who'd lived most of his long life as a soldier, waging battle, didn't turn from a fight with a god. A soldier, though a loner by nature, understood the duty, and loyalty, to those who battled with him.<br><br>The man, the soldier, the loner who'd seen his young brother destroyed by black magick, who'd had his own life upended by it, who fought a god's crazed greed, knew the difference between the dark and the light.<br><br>Being propelled through space by a fellow soldier, a shifter, while they were all still bloody from the battle didn't frighten him-but he'd have preferred any other mode of transportation.<br><br>Through the whirl of wind, the blare of light, the breathless speed (and all right then, there was a bit of a thrill in the speed), he felt his companions. The sorcerer who held more power than any Doyle had known in all his years. The woman who was as much the glue who bound them together as a seer. The mermaid who was all charm and courage and heart-and a pure pleasure for the eyes. The shifter, loyal and brave, and a dead shot as well. And the female-well, wolf now, as the moon had risen just as they'd prepared to shift from the beauty and battles of Capri.<br><br>She howled-no other term for it-and in the sound of it he heard not fear, no, but the same atavistic thrill that beat in his own blood.<br><br>If a man had to align himself with others, had to throw his fate in with others, he could do a hell of a lot worse than these.<br><br>Then he smelled Ireland-the damp air, the green-and the thrill died in him. The fates, canny and cold, would drive him back here where his heart and his life had been broken.<br><br>Even as he geared himself up to deal with it, to do what must be done, they dropped like stones.<br><br>A man who couldn't die could still feel the jolt and insult of hitting the ground hard enough to rattle bones and steal the breath.<br><br>"Bloody hell, Sawyer."<br><br>"Sorry." Sawyer's voice came from his left, and in a kind of gasping wheeze. "It's a lot to navigate. Anybody hurt? Annika?"<br><br>"I'm not hurt. But you." Her voice was a musical croon. "You're hurt. You're weak."<br><br>"Not too bad. You're bleeding."<br><br>Bright as sunlight, she smiled. "Not too bad."<br><br>"Maybe we should try parachutes next time." Sasha let out a quick moan.<br><br>"There now, I've got you."<br><br>As his eyes adjusted, Doyle saw Bran shift, gather Sasha close.<br><br>"You're hurt?"<br><br>"No, no." Sasha shook her head. "Cuts and bumps. And the landing knocked the wind out of me. I should be used to it. Riley? Where's Riley?"<br><br>Doyle rolled, started to push himself up-and pressed a hand into fur. It growled.<br><br>"She's here." He shifted his gaze, met those tawny eyes. Dr. Riley Gwin, renowned archaeologist-and lycan. "Don't so much as think of biting me," he muttered. "She's fine. Like she tells us, she heals fast in wolf form."<br><br>He got to his feet, noted that however rough the landing, Sawyer had come through. Weapons cases, luggage, sealed boxes of research books, maps, and other essentials lay in a somewhat orderly pile a few feet away on the cool, damp grass.<br><br>And of great personal importance to him, his motorcycle stood, upright and undamaged.<br><br>Satisfied, he stretched out a hand to Sawyer, pulled the man to his feet.<br><br>"Not altogether bad."<br><br>"Yeah." Sawyer combed his fingers through his mane of windswept, sun-streaked hair. Then grinned when Annika did a series of cartwheels. "Somebody enjoyed the ride anyway."<br><br>"You did well." Bran dropped a hand on Sawyer's shoulder. "It's a feat, isn't it, juggling six people and all the rest across the sea and sky in, well, a matter of minutes."<br><br>"Got one bitch of a headache out of it."<br><br>"And more."<br><br>Bran lifted Sawyer's hand-the one that had gripped Nerezza's flying hair while he'd shifted her away. "We'll fix that, and anything else needs fixing. We should get Sasha inside. She's a bit shaky."<br><br>"I'm all right." But she remained sitting on the ground. "Just a little dizzy. Please don't," she said quickly, and pushed to her knees toward Riley. "Not yet. Let's just get oriented first. She wants to run," she told the others.<br><br>"She'll be fine. There's no harm here." Bran helped Sasha up. "The woods are mine," he said to Riley. "And now they're yours."<br><br>The wolf turned, bounded away, vanished into the thick trees.<br><br>"She could get lost," Sasha began.<br><br>"She's a wolf," Doyle pointed out. "And likely to find her way around better than the rest of us. She changed, but as we were leaving, and needs her moment. Wolf or woman, she can handle herself."<br><br>He turned his back on the woods where he'd run tame as a child, where he'd hunted, where he'd gone for solitude. This had been his land once, his home-and now it was Bran's.<br><br>Yes, the fates were canny and cold.<br><br>In the house Bran had built on the wild coast of Clare, Doyle could see the memory of his own. Where his family had lived for generations.<br><br>Gone, he reminded himself, centuries ago. The house and the family, gone to dust.<br><br>In its place was the grand, and he'd have expected no less from Bran Killian.<br><br>A fine manor, Doyle mused, with the fanciful touches one might expect from a wizard. Stone-perhaps some of it from the walls of that long-ago home-rising a full three stories, with those fanciful touches in two round towers on either side, and a kind of central parapet that would offer mad views of the cliffs, of the sea, of the land.<br><br>All softened, Doyle supposed would be the word, with gardens fit for the faeries, blooming wild and free, with the mixed perfumes blown about on the windy air.<br><br>Doyle indulged himself for one moment, allowed himself to think of his own mother and how she'd have loved every bit of it.<br><br>Then he put it away.<br><br>"It's a fine house."<br><br>"It's good land. And as I said to Riley, it's yours as much as mine. Well, that's my feeling on it," Bran added when Doyle shook his head.<br><br>"We've come together," Bran continued as the wind tossed his hair, black as the night, around his sharp-boned face. "Were thrown together for a purpose. We've fought and bled together, and no doubt will again. And here we are, standing on where you sprang from, and where I was compelled to build. There's purpose in that as well, and we'll use it."<br><br>In comfort, Annika ran her hand down Doyle's arm. Her long black hair was a sexy tangle from the shift. She had bruises on her remarkable face. "It's beautiful. I can smell the sea. I can hear it."<br><br>"It's a ways down." Bran smiled at her. "But you'll make your way to it easy enough, I wager. In the morning, you'll see more of what it offers. For now, we'd best haul all of our things inside, and settle in a bit."<br><br>"I hear that." Sawyer reached down, hefted some boxes. "And, God, I could eat."<br><br>"I'll make food!" Annika threw her arms around him, kissed him enthusiastically, then picked up her bag. "Is there food to make, Bran? Food I can make while you tend the wounds?"<br><br>"I had the kitchen well stocked." He flicked his fingers at the big, arched double doors. "The house is unlocked."<br><br>"As long as there's beer." Doyle grabbed two weapon cases-his own priority-and started in behind Annika and Sawyer.<br><br>"It hurts him," Sasha quietly told Bran. "I can feel the ache in him, the ache of memories and loss."<br><br>"And I'm sorry for it, truly. But we all know there's a reason for it, why it's here that we've been led to find the last star and end this."<br><br>"Because there's always a price." On a sigh, she leaned against him, closed eyes blue as summer and still hollow from the battle and the shift. "But Annika's right. It's a beautiful house. It's stunning, Bran. I'll want to paint it a dozen times."<br><br>"You'll have time for dozens of dozens." He turned her to him. "I said it was Doyle's and Riley's as it's mine. It's Annika's and Sawyer's as well. But, f&#x2021;idh, it's yours as my heart is yours. Will you live with me here, at least some of the time in our lives together?"<br><br>"I'll live with you here, and anywhere. But now? I should take a look inside and see if it's as wonderful as the outside."<br><br>"It's a true home now that you're here." To dazzle her, he waved a hand. All the windows illuminated. Glowing lights shimmered along garden paths.<br><br>"You take my breath." She sighed it, then picked up the case holding most of her art supplies-her priority.<br><br>They went inside, into a wide entryway with towering ceilings where wide-planked floors gleamed. A heavy table with curled dragons for its legs held crystal balls and a tall vase bursting with white roses.<br><br>It opened to a living area with jewel-tone sofas, more heavy tables, sparkling lamps. And with another wave of the hand, Bran had red-gold flames erupting in a stone fireplace so large the muscular Doyle could have stood upright, arms stretched to either side.<br><br>As he walked in from the back, Doyle raised an eyebrow, toasted with the beer in his hand. "You went for posh, brother."<br><br>"I suppose I did."<br><br>"I'll get more if you'll see to Sawyer. His headache's real enough. I can see it on him. And he's carrying some ugly burns. Annika's hurt more than she lets on."<br><br>"Help Sawyer and Annika," Sasha said. "I'll help Doyle."<br><br>"He's in the kitchen with Annika." Doyle glanced at Sasha. "I can handle bringing in the rest. You've got your own battle scars, Blondie."<br><br>"Nothing major. I'm fine," she told Bran. "The dizziness only lasted a couple minutes this time, and the rest can wait. I could use a glass of wine if you have it."<br><br>"I do, of course. Let me see to him, then I'll help you with the rest."<br><br>She walked outside with Doyle, started to pick up more bags, then just stared out into the woods.<br><br>"She'll be back once she's run it off." Doyle took a pull on his beer. "But you'd be happier with all your chicks in the roost."<br><br>Sasha lifted her shoulders, let them fall. "I would. It's been . . . a day."<br><br>"Finding the second star should put a smile in your eyes instead of sorrow."<br><br>"A year ago I was still denying what I was. I knew nothing of any of you, of gods-dark or bright. I'd never harmed anyone, much less . . ."<br><br>"What you fought and killed wasn't anyone. They were things created by Nerezza to destroy."<br><br>"There were people, too, Doyle. Humans."<br><br>"Mercenaries, paid by Malmon to kill us, or worse. Have you forgotten what they did to Sawyer and Annika in the cave?"<br><br>"No." Sasha hugged her arms tight against the quick chill. "I'll never forget. And I'll never understand how human beings could torture and try to kill for money. Why they'd kill or die for profit. But she does, Nerezza does. She knows that kind of greed, that blind lust for power. And I understand that's what we're fighting. Malmon, he traded everything for it. She took his soul, his humanity, and now he's a thing. Her creature. She'd do the same to all of us."<br><br>"But she won't. She won't because we won't give her anything. We hurt her today. She's the one wounded and bleeding tonight. I've searched for the stars, hunted her for more years than you can know. I got close, or thought I did. But close means nothing."<br><br>He took another long pull from his beer. "I don't like using fate or destiny as reasons or excuses, but the hard fact is we six are together, are meant to be. Are meant to find the Stars of Fortune and end Nerezza. You feel more than others. That's your gift, and your curse, to see and to feel. And without that gift we wouldn't be standing here. It doesn't hurt that you can shoot a crossbow as if born with the bow in one hand and a bolt in the other."<br><br>"Who'd have thought?" She sighed, a pretty woman with long, sunwashed hair and deep blue eyes. One who'd gained muscle and strength, inside and out, over the last weeks. "I feel your heartache. I'm sorry."<br><br>"I'll deal with it."<br><br>"I know you were meant to be here, to walk this land again, to look out at this sea. And not just for the quest for the stars, not just for the fight against Nerezza. Maybe-I'm not sure-but maybe it's for solace."<br><br>Doyle shut down-that was survival. "What was here for me was long ago."<br><br>"And still," she murmured, "the coming here tonight is harder on you, and the getting here tonight was hardest on Riley."<br><br>"Considering we'd just fought off a god and her murderous minions, it wasn't a ride on a carousel for any of us. All right," he said at Sasha's quiet look, "rough on her."<br><br>He put the empty beer bottle in the pocket of his scarred leather coat, hauled up suitcases. "She'll run it off, and be back by morning. Grab what you can, and I'll get the rest. We both know you'd be more help to Bran with the injuries."<br><br>She didn't argue, and he noted that she limped a bit. To settle it, he set the bags down inside, plucked her up.<br><br>"Hey."<br><br>"Easier than arguing. Is the house big enough for you?"<br><br>They passed wide archways and the rooms beyond them. Deep, rich colors, simmering fires in hearths, glinting lights, gleaming wood.<br><br>"It's magnificent. It's huge."<br><br>"I'd say the two of you will have to make a lot of babies to fill it."<br><br>"I-"<br><br>"That got you thinking."<br><br>She'd yet to regain speech when he carried her into the kitchen. There, Sawyer, looking a little less pale, sat on a stool at a long slate-gray counter while Bran treated the burns on his hands.<br><br>Annika, who managed to look gorgeous despite the cuts, the bruises, earnestly saut ed chicken in an enormous frying pan at what Sasha recognized as a professional-grade six-burner range.<br><br>"Okay, now you want to-" Sawyer broke off, hissed as Bran hit a fresh point of pain.<br><br>"I take the chicken out, and put the vegetables in. I can do it," Annika insisted. "Let Bran work."<br><br>"I'll help." Sasha poked Doyle in the shoulder. "Put me down."</p><h2>The CODE OF KINGS: THE LANGUAGE OF SEVEN SACRED MAYA TEMPLES AND TOMBS</h2><p>A journey to the seven most prominent Mayan ruins is accompanied by an explanation of Maya history and culture</p><p>The late <b>Linda Schele</b> was the John D. Murchison Professor of Art at the University of Texas at Austin. Her books include <i>The Blood of Kings</i> (with Mary Miller), <i>A Forest of Kings</i> (with David Freidel), and <i>Maya Cosmos</i> (with David Freidel and Joy Parker). She died in the spring of 1998.<b>From Chapter 1: Pyramid-Mountains and Plaza-Seas</b> <p> Maya scholars have participated in a revolution. The past four decades have seen the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphic writing system and the reading of the history of one of the great civilizations of the world. This decipherment has recovered the names of kings, their families, members of their courts, and artists, artisans, and builders who served them. Growing understanding of Maya imagery has combined with increasingly subtle decipherments of the glyphs to give us new insights into court life, religious ideas, and the politics of the time, as well as the economies and social mechanisms that allowed Maya civilization to flourish. Excavations conducted by archaeologists not only have tested the "truth" of these histories in the ground, but also have sought to understand better the lifeways of the ancient Maya people, from the most exalted to the lowliest members of society. </p><p> As epigraphers who have participated in this revolution, we find that our personal relationship to Maya cities has changed forever. We can't now walk among the buildings without thinking about who built them and why. We now consider them not just as objects of beauty, but also as political and religious statements aimed at an audience of nobles and commoners. Maya buildings were instruments of state that registered Maya identity, religion, and history. </p><p> How different it is to walk through a ruined city when it has become a historical place -- to "read" a building and to know who looks out from a sculpted portrait. The ruins cease to be anonymous places admired only for their beauty and mystery. Instead, they become the works of people who had names and motivations that we can understand, even from our distant points of view. And the buildings and images created by these once-living people become their voices, telling us something about the agendas that guided their decisions, the larger political framework that conditioned those agendas, and the understanding of the world that gave meaning to both. </p><p> We have shared our vision of Maya cities as historical places with people who have toured with us over the years and in public lectures. When we were thinking about what to do in this book, we realized that many more people who visit Maya places and who love Maya art and archaeology might be interested in seeing their architecture through the lens of history. We wanted to show people how to "read" Maya political and religious art and architecture. </p><p> In designing this book, we deliberately picked some of the most famous buildings in Maya archaeology, partially because, famous though they are, they remain virtually anonymous to the people who visit them. Three are in Mexico, three in Guatemala, and one in Honduras, and we selected seven different kinds of buildings to serve as archetypes. These seven are a palace and family shrine center, a pyramid-temple and tomb, a plaza with stelae (upright, carved monuments), a building designed to celebrate the end of an important Maya cycle of time, a court for playing ball, a conjuring house and war monument, and, finally, a conquest period capital from the Guatemala highlands. Although there are other types of Maya buildings, these seven constitute the elements that the ancient Maya considered necessary to charge a city with religious and political meaning. Most cities had all these types of buildings, although their styles varied widely from place to place. </p><p> We have used the nuances of these buildings to explore the way Maya architecture worked and how the Maya generated sacred space within their cities through the use of buildings and the symbolic information contained in them. We have designed the book to operate on multiple levels. On one level, it serves as a guided tour through the buildings. Much of the information necessary to understand the layout and basic contents of each building can be gleaned from the maps and illustrations alone. We have included a map of each building with its components designated by letters or numbers. We have used the same designations as headings in the descriptive sections of the text. Readers can follow our suggested path through the building or they can go to any part of it by finding the section that corresponds to the letter on the building plan. </p><p> The texts discuss each building in progressively greater detail, moving from the general to the specific, so that readers can choose the amount of information they wish to consume and skip over the more detailed discussions when they so desire. The notes provide the scholarly background to our interpretations and add more detailed information to our discussions. We have also included a glossary of gods and supernaturals at the end of the book to serve as a quick reference for those who are less familiar with the Maya world. </p><p> <b>Maya Society in Time and Space </b> </p><p> The Maya lived in a large cultural area that archaeologists call Mesoamerica. Encompassing the region from the deserts of northern Mexico to the eastern third of Honduras and El Salvador, Mesoamerica refers less to geography than to the societies and cultural traditions that occupied this land until the arrival of Europeans. Like the people of Europe, Mesoamericans shared definitions about how to grow and distribute food, what constituted government, and how the world worked, both on the mundane and the cosmological level. </p><p> The land of the Maya occupies the eastern third of Mesoamerica, in what is now southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and western Honduras. This area is covered by ruined cities from a cultural tradition that was 2,500 years old when the Spanish conquered the inhabitants and forever changed their world. The descendants of the Maya who built those ruined cities today number in the millions and speak over two dozen related Maya languages. They communicate with the world over the Internet, yet also live in direct contact with the beliefs and understanding of the world that lay at the heart of the cities built by their ancestors millennia before. </p><p> The topography of the Maya landscape varies enormously, from the volcanic mountains that form a spine along the Pacific coast to the tropical-forest lowlands that comprise the northern two-thirds of the Yukatan peninsula. Rivers cut through the mountains, draining into the Gulf of Mexico via the Grijalva and Usumacinta Rivers and to the Caribbean by the Motagua and numerous smaller rivers. The swampy southern lowlands receive up to 120 inches of rain a year, while the northern lowlands are drier and have no rivers. There in the north, people get their water from cenotes <i>(tz'onot</i> in Maya), sinkholes that dot the limestone terrain of Yukatan. The high-canopy forest that covers the southern lowlands transforms into pine forest in the highlands and into low, scrub forest in the north. </p><p> Archaeologists divide the later history of Mesoamerica into three great periods -- the Preclassic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 200), the Classic (A.D. 200-910), and the Postclassic (A.D. 910-1524). The first of these periods, the <b>Preclassic,</b> saw the rise of the Olmec, the first great civilization that modern scholars recognize in Mesoamerica. Occupying the swampy lowlands surrounding the Tuxtla volcanos in southern Veracruz, the Olmec built the first cities in a landscape that can be described as mountains surrounded by swamps. This extraordinary people created the first kingdoms and developed the templates of worldview and political symbolism that formed the basis of all subsequent societies in Mesoamerica. In a real sense, they invented civilized life in this region of the world. </p><p> By 1000 B.C., the Maya had begun to build villages in the mountainous highlands and lowland forests of eastern Mesoamerica. These early villagers built houses that were much like those still used by their descendants today. They used pole frames and thatched roofs to construct houses with a single room. In some regions, villagers favored houses with oval floor plans, while in others they preferred rectangular forms. The center of the house was always a hearth made of three stones set in a triangle to allow wood to be fed into the fire while cooking. The hearth was the center of family life, where women prepared food and did the work of the household. Men worked in agricultural fields called <i>kol,</i> where they planted maize, beans, squash, and chile. They planted fruit trees of many kinds around their houses and near their cornfields. </p><p> Households consisted of several related adults, and could include couples with young children, adolescents, young adults, and grandparents. Large families provided the people required for farming, a labor-intensive activity that involved yearly cycles of preparing the fields, planting, cultivating, and harvesting. Moreover, large families could help in other activities, such as the building and refurbishing of houses, kitchens, and storerooms, the collection of firewood, the preparation of food, and the repair and maintenance of tools. More specialized crafts included weaving and decorating cloth, the manufacture of tools and household objects of all sorts, and the making of pottery. The Maya could use these products in their own households or exchange them for other goods and services within their communities. As their families grew, villagers built additional houses around courtyards to form compounds. Four houses around a courtyard became one of the characteristic forms of Maya architecture. </p><p> Like other Mesoamerican peoples, the Maya adopted Olmec innovations in symbolic imagery and social institutions. By 500 B.C., the Maya began to build cities in the lowland forests and in the highland mountains. They amplified the traditional layout of the family compound into a square plaza surfaced with plaster and surrounded on three or four sides by pyramids with temples on top. They used tamped earth to build their pyramids in the highlands, and earth and rubble in the lowlands. Some of these very early structures are the largest ever built by the Maya. People flying over them today often think they are natural hills rising ...</p></p><h2>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Monster, Vol. 16</h2><p>� An 18-volume manga series-over 20MM copies sold to date in Japan!<br>� Named the Best Manga of 2006 by Anime Insider.<br>� Awarded the 1997 Media Arts Festival Award for Excellence,&nbsp; in 1999 the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Award, and in 2001 the Shogakukan Award for Best Manga.<br>� Inspired anime, music, and trade book spin-offs in Japan.<br>� From the creator of 20th Century Boys and Yawara.<br>� Released Bi-monthly (every other month).<br><br>MONSTER weaves the riveting story of brilliant Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a famous surgeon with a promising career at a leading hospital.

Until the first century BC, glass was made only in Western Asia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean regions; its manufacture then spread to China and other areas. The peoples of the Roman Empire included the most versatile glassmakers&nbsp;in the ancient world, leading to both widely available low-cost &nbsp;glassware and stunning &nbsp;luxury glass. During &nbsp;the Middle Ages, Islamic glassworkers &nbsp;decorated &nbsp;their fine cut glass with gilding and brilliant enamel. In the&nbsp;15th century, the focus of luxury glassmaking shifted to Venice. Glassmaking &nbsp;in Europe &nbsp;was transformed again in the&nbsp;17th&nbsp;&nbsp;century, when thick-walled &nbsp;objects with cut and engraved ornament were in great demand. <br><br>By the nineteenth century, &nbsp;glassmaking was well established in America, where, as in Europe, industrial processes were developed to supply the rapidly expanding population with glassware for daily use. Within the past&nbsp;50 years glass has gained acceptance as a medium for artistic expression, and the Studio Glass Movement, born in the United &nbsp;States, has inspired artists all over the world to explore its unique properties. <i>Glass </i>tells this sweeping story from ancient times to the present in an accessible text with gorgeous examples.</p></p><p><b>David Whitehouse</b> is Executive Director of the Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York.<b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br><br></b>Despite the ubiquity of glass objects in our lives, &#x201c;it is difficult to identify a book that provides a short, readable, overview&#x201d; of the subject, argues Whitehouse (Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass), senior scholar at the Corning Museum of Glass. Although this is not the most scintillating text, it does the job, while full-color photographs represent beautiful examples of glass objects from around the world. The discovery of glassblowing by the ancient Romans revolutionized production, but techniques of molding, casting, and core-forming glass produced unusual results, such as dimpled tableware of the fifth-century Achaemenids or slumped glass artwork from the 20th century. Glass decorating techniques distinguished glassworkers in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, who used multiple methods to create glass tableware, and also early-modern European glass etchers. Photo captions provide insight into how glassworkers made both the everyday and the extraordinary, from an Iranian molded tumbler to a pitcher cut with delicate green lines. Whitehouse concludes by remarking on the growth of glass as a medium for art and collectibles, and this book will certainly be welcomed by visitors to museums and galleries. Three pages of glossary and further reading round out this succinct presentation of a versatile medium for the utilitarian, decorative, and artistic. (May)<br><br><b>LIBRARY JOURNAL<br></b><br>Whitehouse (senior scholar, Corning Museum of Glass) has compiled an informative history of the creation and use of glass. People have been making glass for over 4000 years, and Whitehouse traces its history from its rough beginnings to the discovery of glassblowing to its rise as an art form. The text is beautifully illustrated with 130 color images of glass from ancient to modern times, drawn from the British Museum and the Corning Museum of Glass collections. Previous works, such as Alan Macfarlane and Gerry Martin's Glass: A World History, focus on the cultural impact of glass and glassmaking; this book traces glassmaking from its beginnings to the present, touching on its global spread in the first century B.C.E. and centuries of innovations in craft and changes in style. A glossary and index complete this well-thought-out book. <br><br>VERDICT A beautifully illustrated history of glass for those interested in knowing how glassmaking began and how it became the art form it is today.

He was highly popular throughout a career that lasted more than seventy years, and his many writings continue to be widely read. He is best known for his novels and short stories of Bertie Wooster and his manservant Jeeves and for his settings of English upper-class society of the pre- and post-World War I era. He lived in several countries before settling in the United States after World War II. During the 1920s, he collaborated with Broadway legends like Cole Porter and George Gershwin on musicals and, in the 1930s, expanded his repertoire by writing for motion pictures. He was honored with a knighthood in 1975.</p>When this collection of novelettes was published in 1917, Wodehouse had already been in print for 15 years-yet he was still at the dawn of his prolific career. Elements that would catch fire in later works first appear here, most notably Jeeves the Butler and Bertie Wooster&#39;s formidable Aunt Agatha, &#34;who had an eye like a man-eating fish.&#34; Frederick Davidson has read some of Wodehouse&#39;s longer works, but he&#39;s better here, mostly because the female characters are limited. He has an almost cynical British voice, yet his own good humor comes through as he nearly drawls the finer points of the comic narrative. D.W.

Hale presents the Renaissance as the age in which, first through cartography, the nations of Europe (Britain included) gained an awareness of being, however precariously, a cohesive entity. But he places as much stress on the countries' developing prejudices, antipathies, and insular ``mini-economies'' as on their sense of kinship or alliance. After chapters mapping the ``discovery'' of Europe as an idea, its countries, and its divisions, Hale crosses these borders to discuss ``transformations,'' ``transmissions,'' and ``migrating styles'' of art and culture. His examples of local adaptations of Italian works are particularly telling, e.g., a Polish translator of Castiglione's Courtier removed the women from its dialogues, sure that his readers would doubt ``their participation in such a cultivated debate.'' Hale, while furnishing essential information on the culture's immense achievements, ultimately stresses Renaissance Europe's blind spots and omissions, shortcomings and contradictions. Sensual indulgence as opposed to new social controls is exemplified by the fact that ``one out of seven'' Britons were accused of sexual misconduct in Elizabethan England and the inclusion of prostitutes as guests at Vatican entertainments; other problems range from the lack of practical theories of social reform to the excess of engineering ideas that were ``theoretically plausible but impractical'' yet were ``accepted by the wisest council of the soberest government[s] of Europe.'' Galileo, who destroyed the very premises of astrology, still ``cast horoscopes for his Medici patrons and their friends.'' While noting Europe's growing sense of modernity, Hale also traces the continent's cultural ``drawing in on itself,'' regions' rising separatism, cities' found-and-lost civility, and individuals' adoption of ``Melancholy'' out of ``hopeless... inner confusion.'' The art descriptions are wittily precise, the illustrations well-chosen, and the quotations often come from superb period translations.

This question proves particularly urgent in the case of those saints who were canonized due to their relation to black slavery. Today, many of their racial virtues seem like racial vices. In this way, the church celebrates Peter Claver, a seventeenth-century Spanish missionary to Colombia, as &#34;the saint of the slave trade,&#34; and extols Mart�n de Porres as the patron saint of mixed race people. But in truth, their sainthoods have upheld anti-blackness much more than they have undermined it. Habituated by anti-blackness, the church has struggled to perceive racial holiness accurately. In the ongoing cause to canonize Pierre Toussaint, a Haitian-born former slave, the church continues to enact these bad racial habits. This book proposes black fugitivity, as both a historical practice and an interpretive principle, to be a strategy by which the church can build new hagiographical habits. Rather than searching inside itself for racial heroes, the church should learn to celebrate those black fugitives who sought refuge outside of it.</p><p>Katie Walker Grimes is assistant professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.

It granted equal liberty of conscience to all and took a firm stand against religious establishment. This respect for religious difference, acclaimed scholar Martha Nussbaum writes, formed our democracy. Yet today there are signs that this legacy is misunderstood. The prominence of a particular type of Christianity in our public life suggests the unequal worth of citizens who hold different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. Other people, meanwhile, seek to curtail the influence of religion in public life in a way that is itself unbalanced and unfair. Such partisan efforts, Nussbaum argues, violate the spirit of our Constitution. <i>Liberty of Conscience</i> is a historical and conceptual study of the American tradition of religious freedom. Weaving together political history, philosophical ideas, and key constitutional cases, this is a rich chronicle of an ideal of equality that has always been central to our history but is now in serious danger.</p><p><b>Martha C. Nussbaum</b> holds appointments in the Philosophy Department, Law School, and Divinity School at the University of Chicago. She is the author of thirteen previous books. Her <i>Cultivating Humanity</i> won the 2002 Grawemeyer Award for Education. She holds thirty honorary degrees from universities around the world. She lives in Chicago and Cambridge.Starred Review. In this engrossing history of the religion clauses of the First Amendment, Nussbaum (<i>Cultivating Humanity</i>) makes a strong, thoroughgoing case for America as a haven of religious liberty for believers of all stripes. Beginning with an illuminating rehabilitation of Rhode Island founder Roger Williams as America's earliest defender of religious equality, Nussbaum continues by examining how Williams's ideals have been both upheld and abandoned throughout the nation's history. After detailing the adoption of the establishment and free exercise clauses, Nussbaum comments at length on how these fairly general, vague clauses have been fleshed out by more than two centuries of case law. Refreshingly, Nussbaum does not add to the acrimonious cacophony around the idea of separation of church and state. Rather than pushing for strict separation, she argues for what philosopher John Rawls calls overlapping consensus, which echoes Williams's belief that citizens who differ greatly on matters of ultimate meaning can still agree to respect each other's liberty of conscience. Nussbaum writes engagingly and with generosity; her critiques, particularly those of opinions written by Justices Scalia and Thomas, are pointed but respectful, and she demonstrates warm regard for Supreme Court plaintiffs who have braved persecution as they have followed the dictates of conscience. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And no wonder&#x2013;as Oliver Smith, the set designer for <i>My Fair Lady</i>, said, he &#x201c;had more energy than anyone I&#x2019;ve ever known.&#x201d; Hugo Vickers, the author of Beaton&#x2019;s acclaimed biography, went back to the original manuscripts to find the unedited material in order to sidestep Beaton&#x2019;s endless retouching and has added, as with the first<i> </i>volume of unexpurgated Beaton, fascinating notes that are as lively as the diary entries themselves. <br><br>Here is Beaton around the world, always in the hot spots of the moment: during the &#x201c;swinging sixties&#x201d; in London, photographing the Queen, doing fashion shoots for British <i>Vogue</i>, and having lunch with No�l Coward and dinner with Cyril Connolly. He is in Morocco with the Rolling Stones; in the Greek islands for a cruise on C�cile de Rothschild&#x2019;s yacht with his former lover, Garbo; in New York attending Truman Capote&#x2019;s Black-and-White Ball; at work on Alan Jay Lerner and Andr� Previn&#x2019;s musical<i> Coco</i> with Katharine Hepburn and on <i>La Traviata</i> with Anna Moffo at the Met&#x2013;he is even caught in the first big New York City blackout; he is at a dinner for President Lyndon Johnson and invited for tea and caviar with Jacqueline Onassis. He&#x2019;s in Mougins to photograph Picasso, and then off to Monaco to see Princess Grace, among many other adventures.<br><br>The eccentric English aesthete Stephen Tennant called Beaton &#x201c;a self-created genius.&#x201d; Though he came out of the Edwardian era, Beaton was a modern polymath with a ferocious drive to be famous, and these diaries reflect his success at working with the most celebrated and creative figures. Reverential, testy, ebullient and acutely observed, they present us with the fascinating minutiae not only of one life but of the best part of a dazzling decade.</p><p>Hugo Vickers compiled <i>The Unexpurgated Beaton</i> and is the author of <i>Gladys, Duchess of Marlborough</i>; <i>Cecil Beaton</i>; <i>Vivien Leigh</i>; <i>Loving Garbo</i>; and <i>Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece</i>, among other books. He lives in London and Hampshire with his wife and three children.As the New Year of 1965 began, Cecil was to be found living at Pelham Place in London and Broadchalke with his friend, Kin, met in San Francisco during Cecil's work on the Warner Brothers film of My Fair Lady. Cecil had persuaded Kin to give up his life in San Francisco and to come to London to study at the Courtauld Institute. Kin had arrived in the summer of 1964, so they had been ensconced together for some six months, by and large happily, though Cecil had to make certain changes to his life and should perhaps have made more.<br><br>Hardly had the New Year opened than the news broke that Sir Winston Churchill, who had reached his 90th birthday on 30 November 1964, had suffered a cerebral thrombosis and was suffering circulatory weakness following a cold.<br><br>His elderly doctor, Lord Moran, became a familiar sight on television news broadcasts and in the newspapers, emerging in his dark overcoat and Homburg hat from Churchill's home in Hyde Park Gate to deliver the latest bulletin. The country waited nervously for the great man to die. As his daughter, Mary Soames, put it, "We marched about the parks in the grey chill days, killing time, while time killed him."<br><br>Cecil was now back, working in England, and regularly took the train from Waterloo to Salisbury, escaping from the busy round of London life to the tranquillity of his garden at Broadchalke. Sitting in the train, he would look out for a small house near the railway line, with a sign in the window advertising "Brides." He would look at it wistfully and say, "There but for the grace of God go I!"<br><br>It was the height of chic for a bride to be photographed by Cecil and relatively rare. He took the official photographs at the wedding of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones in May 1960, and from time to time, for old friends, he would make an exception and become a bride photographer.<br><br>Cecil loved Lord and Lady Lambton for their originality and eccentricity, and for their complete disdain for normal conventions. But he was also a little nervous, for he remembered that it was Tony Lambton's Aunt Violet, the Countess of Ellesmere, who had thrown his sister, Nancy, who had been brought there in innocence by Stephen Tennant, out of her ball in 1928, causing an enormous society row, known as the "Ellesmere Ball" scandal, which occupied columns of print in the society papers in the summer of 1928. Thus any connection with the Lambtons caused Cecil to remember his earlier social insecurity. This was wholly one-sided. The Lambtons found such attitudes hard to understand though they identified it in Cecil.<br><br>Lucinda Lambton, then aged 21, Lord Lambton's eldest daughter, was marrying Henry Harrod, elder son of Sir Roy Harrod, the economist and author of biographies of John Maynard Keynes, and The Prof, about F. A. Lindemann, and his wife, Wilhelmine ("Billa") Cresswell, who in old age became a friend of the Prince of Wales.<br><br>The young Harrods had two children, Henry Barnaby, born in July that year, and Nathaniel, born in March 1967. The marriage was to last eight years, ending in divorce in 1973.<br><br>FENTON, NORTHUMBERLAND 20 JANUARY 1965<br><br>Came up on the night sleeper for Lucy's wedding.

And it was.<br><br>A pre-nuptial gaiety in cold dark King's Cross Station with Lucian Freud and Ann [Fleming], Paddy Leigh Fermor and Joan, Ali F. [Forbes] etc. Arrival in north before daylight, cold, bleak moor scenery, Cheviot Hills, and our goal a turreted black and white Gothic house with light blazing in every window, and they had been blazing since five o'clock this morning when the chefs had started cooking for the wedding breakfast. Fires were also blazing in the hearth of every room and the corridors were a serried mass of blue hyacinths which, with the wood fires, scented the air. Tony appeared bleary-eyed in dressing gown, likewise Judy [Montagu], then Diana [Cooper] barefooted with head tied in nightcap. Big joking at big breakfast.<br><br>Tony, whom I like in spite of his appalling caddishness, said that the bridegroom's mother was appearing at the wedding in a dress she'd bought for �20!-that the father had got drunk last night. (Later Billa and Roy explained they were so worried-L. L. had refused to speak to her fianc� on the telephone, shouted that the whole thing was a mistake, which the Harrods thought too, hence Roy took to the bottle, fell, hurt his eye and had to be guided to bed, screams from six children, extraordinary rustic chef decorations, a cross of grapes that someone said was part of Churchill's imminent funeral decor, or as Paddy suggested, looked like part of a voodoo rite in Haiti. A peacock of fruit, a swan made of bananas and violets.<br><br>Bindy, still in plaster with broken leg, shouting to people to leave her Clapham Junction bedroom, while she dressed the children's hair. Tony shouting to the bride in the bath, "Why in the world didn't you sign that document as you were told? Now the whole thing is ruined and we'll have to pay death duties." Lucy, walking around in a bath towel, preparations at their height, great excitement under the generalship of Judy, a preview of the church at Wooler, garish decorations of daffodils, with sun coming through them gave wintry glow, Bindy dressed and looking large and ungainly in white velvet, frogging bows, white fur and Victorian hair and tiara.<br><br>Bridesmaids moss-green Anna Kareninas, Ned, Hussar, likewise with fur hat, Judy's minute child dressed as a daffodil to strew flowers in bride's path as she came down it.<br><br>Lucy not wanting dugget, preferred to walk along the muddy path in the churchyard, made a delightful picture of bride with raven-haired highwayman bridegroom as half an hour later, after singing Child's hymns, snow and snow, "we plough the fields and scatter," processed against the sun, through the gravestones, with an excited village populace of gay-faced simpletons gawking and smiling. Military precision as the cars brought the cort�ge back to the black and white castle. For the Breakfast the board not only groaned but bellowed with the suckling pig, the geese, gammons of beef, hams, game pastries and eclairs (of which I had brought 300 with me on the night train). Mulled claret made of marvellous claret, the bride nervous, shrieking at her sisters with a frown on her face and brandishing a knife at the photographers who wanted the conventional picture of her cutting the cake.<br><br>How it all went so smoothly Tony did not know, for any moment there could be a clash of temperament. The bride asked Desmond Guinness why he'd come to the wedding and shouted at nannies who proffered their behinds when the photographers tried to take pictures of the children.<br><br>Seeing Michael Wishart she asked him what he thought of the wedding. "I thought you looked beautiful," he said. "I don't want to hear that sort of thing. What did you think of the wedding?" "Oh, it was beautiful, magical with the flowers and the Mozart cantata." "I don't want that sort of rubbish. I want to know what you'd write if you were describing it for the newspapers."<br><br>POST-MORTEM ON THE WEDDING<br><br>Jokes about the two families by each family. Judy to Roy: "You're not so much escorting the bride's mother as wielding a hunking cripple up and down the aisle." The bride has telephoned. She remembered every detail, the wedding did not go by in a haze. She only did not remember many of the people but saw some old servant 20 years dead. "How's Henry? He's not here," remembered Lucy.<br><br>He is calm of disposition, says "Other people would find Lucy difficult but she does not upset me." He writes a letter and finishes the crossword puzzle while she is railing about the marriage being an abortive idea: "I must give it up now." Roy naturally disturbed, Billa too. Not so Henry. Later Bindy is given by a child a batch of congratulatory telegrams too late for arrival before the couple departed. Jokes about Aunt Maddy and then the laughter stops. "My heart looks forward to seeing you with ecstasy and trepidation-Love Henry." We discover that this was sent earlier to "Miss Lambton" marked "Personal and confidential," and should have arrived early yesterday morning. People were a little embarrassed at this joke session going wrong, as indeed they should be.<br><br>Harrods very keen to see the newspapers and the photographs, and reading about the reports when eventually they arrive.<br><br>More than anything else Cecil loved to be at Reddish House, Broadchalke, quietly supervising changes and improvements to the house, the creation of a studio in which to paint, making changes in the garden, and inspecting the various successes and failures he found there. It was the nearest thing he could have to an Arcadian idyll. His diaries are full of stories about domestic dramas involving cooks who came and went, some markedly better than others. He was happiest when at Broadchalke with Kin, or when his secretary Eileen Hose came to stay, or friends such as Alan Tagg and Charles Colville.<br><br>At this time he was particularly interested in painting and even wondered if this might be a new late-life career.<br><br>All these weeks I have been painting, sometimes with a modicum of satisfaction though often with that appalling feeling of frustration one only knows when one's high hopes are dashed to despair.<br><br>All the while Kin was with me and all the while he was sympathetic to every mood. I had thought he might be a difficult character but this was not the case. He is always mindful of my ill humours, makes excuses for my bad behaviour, likes being alone with me, does not need neighbours, does not want company.

His books include <i>Petals of Blood</i>, for which he was imprisoned by the Kenyan government in 1977. He lives in Irvine, California.1<br><br> There were many theories about the strange illness of the second Ruler of the Free Republic of Aburiria, but the most frequent on people's lips were five.<br><br> The illness, so claimed the first, was born of anger that once welled up inside him; and he was so conscious of the danger it posed to his well-being that he tried all he could to rid himself of it by belching after every meal, sometimes counting from one to ten, and other times chanting ka ke ki ko ku aloud. Why these particular syllables, nobody could tell. Still, they conceded that the Ruler had a point. Just as offensive gases of the constipated need to be expelled, thus easing the burden on the tummy, anger in a person also needs a way out to ease the burden on the heart. This Ruler's anger, however, would not go away, and it continued simmering inside till it consumed his heart. This is believed to be the source of the Aburirian saying that ire is more corrosive than fire, for it once eroded the soul of a Ruler.<br><br> But when did this anger take root? When snakes first appeared on the national scene? When water in the bowels of the earth turned bitter? Or when he visited America and failed to land an interview with Global Network News on its famous program Meet the Global Mighty? It is said that when he was told that he could not be granted even a minute on the air, he could hardly believe his ears or even understand what they were talking about, knowing that in his country he was always on TV; his every moment--eating, shitting, sneezing, or blowing his nose--captured on camera. Even his yawns were news because, whether triggered by boredom, fatigue, hunger, or thirst, they were often followed by some national drama: his enemies were lashed in the public square with a sjambok, whole villages were blown to bits or people were pierced to death by a bows-and-arrows squad, their carcasses left in the open as food for hyenas and vultures.<br><br> It is said that he was especially skillful in creating and nursing conflicts among Aburirian families, for scenes of sorrow were what assuaged him and made him sleep soundly. But nothing, it seemed, would now temper his anger.<br><br> Could anger, however deeply felt, cause a mystery illness that defied all logic and medical expertise?<br><br> 2<br><br> The second theory was that the illness was a curse from the cry of a wronged he-goat. It is said that some elders, deeply troubled by the sight of blood flooding the land, decided to treat this evil as they had epidemics that threatened the survival of the community in the olden days: but instead of burying the evil inside the belly of a beast by inserting flies, standing for the epidemic, into its anus, they would insert the Ruler's hair, standing for the evil, into the belly of a he-goat through its mouth. The evil-carrying goat, standing for the Ruler, would then become an outcast in the land, to be driven out of any region where its cry announced its evil presence.<br><br> Led by a medicine man, they mixed the hair, obtained secretly from the Ruler's barber, with grass, salt, and magic potions and gave it to the goat to swallow. Needle and thread in hand, the medicine man started sewing the seven orifices of the body beginning with the anus. The struggling he-goat gave out a bloodcurdling cry and, before the medicine man could seal its mouth, it escaped. It is said that it cried grief across the land, until the Ruler heard the cry and, learning about the curse, which he imagined to be a call for a coup, sent soldiers to hunt down the he-goat and all involved. Rumor has it that the goat, the barber, the medicine man, the elders, and even the soldiers were given over to the crocodiles of the Red River to ensure eternal silence about the curse. And it was to mark this day of his deliverance that the Ruler had the picture of the Red River added to Buri notes, the only picture besides his own to honor the Aburirian currency.<br><br> Still, he worried about the fact that the goat had a beard, and he secretly consulted an oracle in a neighboring country, who assured him that only a bearded spirit could seriously threaten his rule. Though he read this as meaning that no human could overthrow him, for, since they had no bodily form, spirits could never grow beards, he became sensitive to beards and then decreed what came to be known as the Law of the Beard, that all goats and humans must have their beards shaved off.<br><br> There are some who dispute the story of the bearded he-goat and even argue that the Law of the Beard applied only to soldiers, policemen, civil servants, and politicians, and that the herdsmen shaved their he-goats out of their own volition, shaving goats' beards then being the fashion among Aburirian herdsmen.<br><br> These skeptics wondered: what has the cry of a he-goat whose anus, ears, and nose being sealed, have to do with the strange illness that befell the Ruler?<br><br> 3<br><br> Others now came up with a third theory, which said that since nothing lasts forever, the illness had something to do with the aging of his rule: he had sat on the throne so long that even he could not remember when his reign began. His rule had no beginning and no end; and judging from the facts one may well believe the claim. Children had been born and had given birth to others and those others to others and so on, and his rule had survived all the generations. So that when some people heard that before him there had been a first Ruler, preceded by a succession of governors and sultans all the way from the eras of the Arabs, the Turks, the Italians, to that of the British, they would simply shake their heads in disbelief saying, no, no, those are just the tales of a daydreamer: Aburiria had never had and could never have another ruler, because had not this man's reign begun before the world began and would end only after the world has ended? Although even that surmise was shot through with doubts, for how can the world come to an end?<br><br> 4<br><br> The fourth theory asserted that his illness had its origins in all the tears, unshed, that Rachael, his legal wife, had locked up inside her soul after her fall from his grace.<br><br> The Ruler and his wife had fallen out one day when Rachael asked questions about the schoolgirls who, rumors claimed, were often invited to the State House to make his bed, where he, like the aging white man of the popular saying, fed on spring chicken. Of course, the Ruler would never admit to aging, but he had no problems with the "white man" comparison, and so he amended the proverb to say that a white man renews his youth with spring chicken. Imagine how he must have felt about Rachael's attempt to deny him his fountains of youth! How indiscreet and indecorous of her to ask the unaskable! Since when could a male, let alone a Ruler, be denied the right to feel his way around women's thighs, whether other men's wives or schoolgirls? What figure of a Ruler would he cut were he to renounce his right to husband all women in the land in the manner of the lords of Old Europe, whose droits de seigneur gave them the right to every bride-to-be?<br><br> Rachael thought she was being reasonable. I know you take the title Father of the Nation seriously, she told him. You know that I have not complained about all those women who make beds for you, no matter how many children you sire with them. But why schoolgirls? Are they not as young as the children you have fathered? Are they not really our children? You father them today and tomorrow you turn them into wives? Have you no tears of concern for our tomorrow?<br><br> They were dining in the State House, and to Rachael the evening was very special because it was the first time in a long while that they were alone together: the burdens of presiding over the nation hardly ever gave them time to share meals and engage in husband-and-wife talk. Rachael believed in the saying that clothes maketh a woman, and that night she had taken particular care with her appearance: a white cotton dress with a V-shaped collar, short sleeves pleated at the edges, a necklace highlighting her slender neck, rings on her fingers, and dangling from her elegant ears, diamonds sparkling all about her.<br><br> We can very well imagine the scene. Guiding his fork unerringly toward his lips, the Ruler was about to place a morsel of chicken into his mouth, when suddenly, at Rachael's words, the fork froze in midair; slowly, he lowered the fork to the plate, the piece of chicken still on it, took the napkin and wiped his lips with deliberation. Before replacing the napkin on the table, he turned to his wife and asked: Rachael, did I really hear you say that I have been forcing myself on schoolchildren? That I don't cry over our tomorrow? Have you ever heard of a Ruler who cries, except maybe, well, never mind him, and where did those daily tears of a grown man lead him? He lost his throne. Do you want me to end up as he did?<br><br> There is always a difference between a thought and its description: what the Ruler had been dwelling on when lowering the fork to the table and wiping his lips with a corner of the napkin was not the fate of a Ruler who wept and so lost his throne but rather what he would have to do to make Rachael understand that he, the Ruler, had power, real power over everything including . . . yes . . . Time. He shuddered at the thought. Even before the shuddering completed its course, he had made up his mind.<br><br> Speaking with studied calm, a faint smile on his face, he told Rachael that the unfinished meal would be their last supper together, that he would go away to give her time to think about the implications of her allegations, and since she would need space to think, he would bring to pass what had been written in the scriptures: In My Father's House Are Many Mansions.

With a talent recognised by discerning critics from his very first appearance on the stage, he gained a worldwide reputation playing roles on the screen such as Fagin in OLIVER TWIST and THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT. His performance as Colonel Nicholson in BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI won him an Oscar and in his later years he captivated a new generation of admirers as George Smiley in TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and Ben Kenobi in STAR WARS. Guinness was a man who vigorously guarded his privacy and, despite publishing an autobiography, BLESSINGS IN DISGUISE, and two volumes of his diaries, he remained an enigma to the general public and a mystery even to his family and closest friends. After his death in August 2000, his widow Merula asked the author Piers Paul Read, who had been a friend of her husband, to write his biography. Given full co-operation by the Guinness family and free access to Sir Alec&#39;s papers, including his private and unpublished diaries, Read has written a penetrating and perceptive account of an intriguing and complex man.</p><p>Piers Paul Read is the author of thirteen acclaimed novels, most recently ALICE IN EXILE, and four works of non-fiction, among them a history of the crusading order, THE TEMPLARS and the international bestseller ALIVE! Past novels have won the Hawthornden Prize and the Geoffrey Faber, Somerset Maugham and James Tail Black Awards. His occasional journalism includes a profile of Sir Alec Guinness written for THE INDEPENDENT MAGAZINE in 1985.Like the other most celebrated British actors of his time -- John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier -- Alec Guinness loved the stage above all but became known throughout the world for the roles he played in movies. Like those other actors, he had mixed feelings about this to the end of his life, hewing to the conventional view of his time and place that movies are somehow less serious and important than the theater, but unlike the others he rarely went back to the stage after his first important movie appearance, as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's adaptation of "Great Expectations." That may have troubled him, but not enough to do much about it -- for which we must be grateful, for his enduring legacy is a long succession of brilliant performances that can be enjoyed and marveled at as long as movies exist. <p>It is the way of the world that he became most famous for one of his least important roles: as Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, the Jedi knight of the "Star Wars" series; this made him a bundle of money and brought more fan mail than he cared to read, much less answer, but, Piers Paul Read reports, "he was depressed that his celebrity was based on work that he himself did not esteem." Presumably he would have cited as his best work the roles of Col. Nicholson in "The Bridge on the River Kwai," Gully Jimson in "The Horse's Mouth" (to my mind best of all) and Jock Sinclair in "Tunes of Glory," but many others would insist on including Herbert Pocket, Fagin in "Oliver Twist" and the many roles he played in the immortal Ealing Studios comedies of the late 1940s and early '50s, notably "Kind Hearts and Coronets," "The Lavender Hill Mob," "The Man in the White Suit" and "The Ladykillers." </p><p>Just typing out the titles gives me a frisson: All of the films cited above are among the treasures of my youth and have remained treasures ever since -- and credit for that goes to Guinness. Like millions of others, I was captivated by his range, his sympathy, his wit and -- this above all -- his ability to lose himself so completely in the characters he played that they became utterly real and discrete. Unlike almost all other movie stars, whose presence as stars, as themselves, is always on the screen, Guinness was "a man of a thousand faces," none of them his own. </p><p>For this he was occasionally criticized, as being a superb character actor but nothing more. Gielgud, who was his mentor and whom he revered, cut him to the quick when, as a young man, Guinness aspired to play Hamlet. "I can't think why you want to play big parts," Gielgud said. "Why don't you stick to those funny little men you do so well instead of trying to be important?" Guinness's ambition was "to escape from the confines of character acting into the amplitude of a major role," as eventually he did on stage and in the movies, but when he got them he brought the character actor's sensibility to them. It was his greatest strength. </p><p>So now, five years after his death at age 86, comes Piers Paul Read to honor him -- suffocate him, more than a few readers will think -- with the proverbial doorstopper of a biography. As Guinness's ardent admirer, I don't really mind excess piled atop excess in his case, but there's a lot more here than most people will want to know. The biographer of an actor who played a couple of thousand roles is faced with the same problem as the biographer of a famous athlete: Does the reader really need play-by-play of every game? It's a forest-and-trees problem, and Read hasn't solved it. Too much space is given to minor and/or forgettable parts that Guinness played, while some of his more interesting and consequential ones -- Prince Faisal in "Lawrence of Arabia," for instance -- are rushed past in an unseemly and unhelpful hurry. Read, best known as the author of Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, is a good writer and diligent researcher, but in this case less would indeed have been more. </p><p>Still, for those curious about the man behind the thousand faces, there is much here to savor. To Read's credit, at the end of his nearly 600 pages of text, a bit of the mystery about a singularly mysterious man has been lifted, if not wholly removed. Born in 1914 to an unmarried woman who never told him who his father was -- it appears to have been a Scottish banker named Andrew Geddes, who gave young Alec a measure of financial support and included him in his will -- he mostly loathed her to the end of her own very long life. A boozer and (her son's word) a "whore," she often mortified him yet repeatedly clung to him. In a class-conscious country, all this left him "uneasy about his own standing in English society, and acutely embarrassed by his own lack of a background" as well as with "awkward and inhibited feelings for his human relatives," on whom he lavished less overt affection than he accorded his beloved dogs and other animals. </p><p>He was deeply reserved and deeply private, though Read senses strong passions beneath that serene exterior. The precise nature of those passions remains yet another mystery. Guinness was happily married to the former Merula Salaman for more than six decades, and they seem to have shared a powerful physical attraction -- in one of his many letters to her he said, "And the hours of love making we can have my poppet -- just you and me -- oh its too exciting, and heavenly" -- but there is also a good deal of essentially anecdotal reason to believe that he "enjoyed the company of homosexuals, and a degree of voyeuristic flirtation with handsome young men." </p><p>Whether this is all merely a matter of the higher gossip or points to things deep in Guinness cannot be known, and indeed no one appears to have claimed to have had a homosexual encounter or relationship with him. Ambivalence about one's sexuality obviously is scarcely uncommon, and perhaps even more widespread in the theater and films, where the incidence of homosexuality is high. Obviously, conflicted sexuality and repressed passions could have had more than a little to do with Guinness's commitment from a very early age to acting, which permits people to channel their own feelings into the characters they portray and thus to express those feelings while simultaneously concealing them. </p><p>He was in any case a complicated man, capable of friendship and gregariousness but also aloof and self-contained. He was orderly to a fault, nagging Merula about her indifference to domestic neatness, yet often pulling back with an expression of affection and admiration for her. She absolutely adored him, but he cannot have been easy to live with, since pouring himself into his characters meant becoming them at home as well as on the stage or the set. He was given to depression and self-doubt but never capitulated to either; at his core, he was strong. He was a convert to Catholicism, which played a large role in his life, though he was torn between "the man who loved 'gossipy wicked' lunches and the man who yearned for the serenity that came when he felt filled with the Grace of God." Apart from animals, he loved to garden, to loll about his handsome house in the country and to travel -- which was fortunate, as his movie roles took him all over the world. </p><p>In his work he was utterly professional. David Cornwell (aka John le Carr�) found him "amazing" as he worked on his brilliant television portrayal of George Smiley in "Smiley's People," amazing "in that he not only knew his own lines, he knew everyone's lines, and he had a clear idea of how a scene should play. What the dramatic energy was. What story point was being made and where the camera would be looking. And he would write himself out of the dialogue if necessary -- he could steal a scene with his back. You couldn't take your eyes off him. I found him hypnotic on stage or on the screen." </p><p>Absolutely correct. It was my good fortune to be in London in the winter of 1989 and to acquire a ticket for "A Walk in the Woods," the two-character play in which he and Edward Herrmann starred. It isn't much of a play, as both actors seemed to know, but in the role of the Russian diplomat Guinness dominated the stage; since Herrmann is himself an accomplished and highly professional actor, that is saying something. As it turned out, that play was Guinness's final appearance on the stage. Lucky me, to have seen it. <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Today, I will walk on air.<br><br> Tom&#x2019;s hot-air balloon, the Floating Island, hovers above us, a cloud of tofu-colored silk trapped in netting. After scores of solo flights, Tom finally deemed it safe enough to bring me aboard. I run my hands over the inner wall of the bamboo basket, which strains at the stakes pinning it to the ground. Both the balloon and I are itching to take off.<br><br> Outside the basket, Tom holds out his tongue to test the wind. The bald spot on his head is growing back, to my relief. He hadn&#x2019;t wanted the haircut, but I had insisted after he agreed to swipe me a costly <i>chuen pooi</i> bulb from his father&#x2019;s next shipment.<br><br> &#x201c;Wind&#x2019;s blowier than I thought,&#x201d; he mutters, looking askance at the deserted hills of the Presidio Military Reservation. We use English with each other out of habit. At school, they prohibit us from speaking our native Cantonese.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hardly more than a baby&#x2019;s breath! You&#x2019;re not having second thoughts, are you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; His smooth &#x201c;good fortune&#x201d; forehead wrinkles. Tom has the kind of golden face that stays handsome even when he&#x2019;s worried or annoyed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already onto third and fourth.&#x201d;<br><br> I wince at the mention of &#x201c;four.&#x201d; Tom glances at me standing motionless. I&#x2019;ve never told him that I don&#x2019;t like fours, after a lifelong string of mishaps involving that digit. He knows I normally scoff at my ma&#x2019;s fortune-telling superstitions. He would just tease me.<br><br> But today, I refuse to be outdone by a number. I force a grin. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t spend two hours pumping the balloon with air to keep my feet on the ground.&#x201d;<br><br> The predawn April chill makes me shiver through my quilted jacket. I can&#x2019;t deny the light breeze. But we&#x2019;re only making a quick trip up and down&#x2014;ten minutes of weightless suspension, tops.<br><br> A portable stove with a funnel top directs heat through a hose into the throat of the balloon. It puffs up like a proud mother owl. I fill my own lungs, and my excitement surges once again. Flying!<br><br> Crouching, Tom scoops more coal into the stove with his spench, the half-spade half-wrench tool he made himself. He uses the wrench side to lock the stove door. &#x201c;Stop bouncing. You&#x2019;ll break my basket.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stop worrying. They use bamboo for tiger cages. I can&#x2019;t be worse than a tiger.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know yourself very well.&#x201d;<br><br> Hardy-har. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to be a tiger if I want to have my own global business.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t bite anyone.&#x201d; A smile slips out, and my heart jumps. After Ma read our signs last month and pronounced us harmonious, Tom had gone strange on me, rarely smiling.<br><br> I grin back, but his gaze slides away. He pulls his newsboy cap over his head and tugs on his gloves, licking the wind one more time. Liftoff is imminent.<br><br> He yanks out the first few stakes with the spench. &#x201c;Be careful near the drag rope, and don&#x2019;t touch anything. By that, I mean do not make contact between yourself and any part of the Island.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Even my feet?&#x201d;<br><br> He groans. The basket jerks as he digs out a stake. Once the last one is removed, he&#x2019;ll swing over the rim like an acrobat as the balloon floats upward. My skin warms as I imagine the two of us snuggled in this bamboo capsule.<br><br> The silk deflates ever so slightly on one side. Maybe the winds are more combatant than I thought. With my hands folded behind my back, I examine the key-shaped valve on the hose that controls airflow into the balloon.<br><br> His teakwood eyes peer evenly at me. &#x201c;I forgot something. Be back in a second. Don&#x2019;t touch <i>anything</i>. Remember the kite?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t stop mentioning it long enough for me to forget.&#x201d; Last August, he told me not to let the string run on the peony kite he made me, but I couldn&#x2019;t resist, and it flew right into the Pacific Ocean.<br><br> He hikes back to his cart and is soon hidden by a grove of pine trees. What did he forget? We unloaded everything&#x2014;tools, ropes, and candied ginger in case of nausea.<br><br> The silk caves even more. &#x201c;Tom? The Island is collapsing!&#x201d; The breeze eats my words.<br><br> I tug at my hair. My arms still ache from holding up the silk as it inflated earlier. If the balloon collapses, we&#x2019;ll have to come back, and we may not get another opportunity for weeks. Ba expects me at the laundry at eight, and Tom&#x2019;s father rarely gives him a day off from the herb shop.<br><br> No response. I promised I wouldn&#x2019;t touch anything, but surely he&#x2019;d understand.<br><br> I finger the key used to regulate hot air flow into the balloon. It&#x2019;s warm. I slowly twist, and within seconds, the silk becomes plump again. Ha! Easy as catching rain.<br><br> The basket suddenly lifts. Too much heat! I try to return the key to its original position, but I&#x2019;m thrown off-balance as one of only four remaining stakes pops out of the ground. <i>Four</i>.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; I grab onto the side of the basket, watching in horror as another stake begins to uproot, then another. In desperation, I grab again at the key but somehow pull it straight out of the socket. Heart thundering, I jam it back in, twisting and twisting, but nothing catches. The last stake unplugs like a rotting tooth, and the Island breaks free.<br><br> I start to rise, up, up, and away.<br><br> I clutch the side of the basket, hanging on for dear life. For a moment, I consider jumping off, but the balloon rises too fast, and soon I&#x2019;m high enough to see Tom and Winter, his father&#x2019;s draft horse, over the trees. &#x201c;Tom!&#x201d;<br><br> Tom tears at his hair when he sees me. He hurries back, cupping his hands to his mouth and yelling something, but the wind blows his words away. He shakes his fist. Is he angry? There&#x2019;s a panicked jerkiness to his movements that I&#x2019;ve never seen before.<br><br> My stomach drops as the balloon tips to one side. I glance down at the shrinking scenery, a hundred feet below me now. Ropes hang from the ring that secures the netting, but I don&#x2019;t dare tamper with them, as any mistakes this high up could be catastrophic.<br><br> <i>Ancestors! I&#x2019;m not ready to join you in the afterlife.<br></i><br><i> Good-bye, solid Earth. I hope you remember how I always tried to sweep up after myself, and how I did not dig a single unnecessary hole upon your surface. Good-bye, dear Tom. There are few girls in Chinatown, but with your quick mind and warm heart, you will have your choice of any of them&#x2014;just please do not choose the dainty Ling-Ling, who has held a candle for you since the fifth grade.<br></i><br> A flock of seagulls squawks insults beside the basket, and a cold streak runs through me. They&#x2019;ll puncture the silk. &#x201c;Shoo, you flying rats!&#x201d;<br><br> The Island rocks and bobs, and I can barely hang on to the contents of my stomach as the seagulls swoop around me.<br><br> I never thought too hard about my convictions and wonder if it&#x2019;s too late now. Ba is Catholic, but Ma prefers the traditionals&#x2014;Buddhism and Taoism, sprinkled with a good dose of Confucianism, which is more of a philosophy, anyway. With Eastern religion, no one cares if you pick and choose the ingredients for your particular moral soup, as long as you have some soup, preferably one with lots of ginger and&#x2014;<br><br> I remember the candied ginger in my pocket. As I unwrap the waxy package, I drop most of the candies but manage to hang onto one, and I hurl it as best I can at the seagulls. In a flurry of wings and beaks, they fly off after it.<br><br> I nearly sob in relief. That&#x2019;s one bridge crossed. Now what? My eyes catch on the grappling hook that Tom called the drag rope. Maybe it&#x2019;s like an anchor? I drop it over the side.<br><br> The basket jerks as the hook reaches the end of the line.<br><br> Nothing happens at first, but after a good minute, the Island finally stops swinging about. I am not descending, but neither am I ascending. The basket has leveled out about a hundred and fifty feet above the ground and is slowly drifting west. I can make out the blond blocks of St. Clare&#x2019;s School for Girls in the distance. The irony that I will finally glimpse its inner courtyard just when I&#x2019;m about to expire leaves a bitter note on my tongue.<br><br> A new sun has rinsed the sky pink and yellow. Ma will be stirring the <i>juk</i>, rice porridge, right about now, believing me to be gathering mushrooms with Tom. My brother, Jack, will be wiping condensation from the windows before leaving for the Oriental Public School.<br><br> I must get out of this alive. That <i>chuen pooi</i> bulb was going to be our ticket to a good life.<br><br> &#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve bought us out of Chinatown! I had a plan!&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve gone stark raving mad. I am talking to a balloon, one hot air bag to another.<br><br> A rope hits me in the head, and I grab it to steady myself. When I pull, the silk deflates a little, then the basket falls a notch, and a moment of weightlessness sends a shock through me. Was that why Tom was shaking his fist at me? He was telling me to pull.<br><br> I peer into the throat of the balloon and cautiously give the rope another tug. The basket spins, then drops several feet. I fall down in a heap, as dizzy as a fly in a whisk.<br><br> The balloon jerks, but I don&#x2019;t dare peek over the side, afraid of tumbling out. Once my head stops spinning, I stare up into the throat again. There are three ropes hanging. I give one of the others the barest tug, bracing myself, and the balloon begins to rotate in the other direction.<br><br> &#x201c;Mercy, keep your weight on the floor. You&#x2019;re doing great.&#x201d; Tom&#x2019;s voice sounds distant, coming from somewhere under the basket.<br><br> I want to sob in relief. &#x201c;Tom?&#x201d; I cry.<br><br> Not a minute later, he swings a leg over the side and starts expertly manning the ropes inside the basket with me. I stop myself from hugging his ankles.<br><br> &#x201c;You did well. Dropped it enough for me to catch the grapple. See, this pulls the main vent and helps you go straight down.&#x201d;<br><br> In no time, we&#x2019;re back on the ground, the silk billowing like a cream-colored ocean. Tom helps me up, and I hug him close, trembling. His solid warmth defuses all my fear, replacing it with something giddy and hopeful. If I had known my flight of terror would have ended in Tom&#x2019;s arms, I might have volunteered for it.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I should&#x2019;ve listened.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m sorry.

The development of Russia was different from that of the rest of Europe. The natural poverty of geographical conditions made it extremely difficult to construct an effective regime, and a &#34;patrimonial&#34; state arose in which the country was conceived as the personal property of the tsar. The book describes the evolution of this regime, and analyzes the political behaviour of the principal social groupings, peasantry, nobility, bourgeoisie and clergy, and accounts for their failure to stand up to the increasing absolutism of the tsar. Only the intelligentsia were able to make such a stand, and the book shows how in countering this challenge, Russia developed into a bureaucratic police state.</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettes<b>Richard Pipes&nbsp;</b>was for many years a professor of history at Harvard University.

Illustrated with original linocuts of 26 different vessels from around the globe, this entertaining book is a pleasure to read and share with others.</p><p>James Dodd&#39;s hearty linocuts show in a very simple way the diversity of different boat rigs. The alphabet of Boats started life as a teething book for his son and daughter: six English east coast boats printed onto wood and bound by a spliced rope ring. As his children cut their teeth, so the idea of an alphabet grew. Defining the difference between a Smack and a Bawley, a Ketch and a Lugger, from Ark to Zulu, for young and old, this alphabet will both amuse and inform. He is now teaching his children to sail, which as brought about a follow up book, &#34;ABC of Boat Bits&#34;, naming the parts of a small gaff-rigged sloop.</p><h2>Robert Asprin&#39;s Myth-Quoted (Myth-Adventures)</h2><p><b>A CAMPAIGN OF MYTH-INFORMATION</b><p></p><p>Since it was founded, M.Y.T.H.

Johnson, it seems, is perfectly happy with the faith of his father and as accustomed to the Catholic Church &#34;as a much-loved old teddy bear or a favorite armchair or a smelly old favorite dog.&#34; A journalist and historian, Johnson has written an apologia in which he answers such basic questions as &#34;What is God, then?&#34; and &#34;Is there an alternative to God?&#34; His answers surprise, provoke, and even provide comfort.<p>Paul Johnson is a historian whose work ranges over the millennia and the whole gamut of human activities. He regularly writes book reviews for several UK magazines and newspapers, such as the <em>Literary Review</em> and <em>The Spectator</em>, and he lectures around the world. He lives in London, England.</p></p><h2>Camille Pissarro</h2><p>In this fully illustrated work, the great-grandson of Camille Pissarro illuminates the process of painting as Pissarro engaged in it, describes his work on innovative projects with Degas and Ce+a7zanne, and chronicles the events of his life.</p><p><b>Terence Maloon</b> is Curator of Special Exhibitions at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. <b>Richard Shiff,</b> Effie Marie Cain Regents Chair in Art at the University of Texas, Austin, has written extensively on Impressionism. <b>Joachim Pissarro</b>, great-grandson of Camille Pissarro, is Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

The author relies on solid authorities rather than familial sentimentality to give readers a panoramic view of Pissarro's work, which, when considered collectively, defies the simple categorizations of impressionist or neoimpressionist. The first chapters provide a scholarly but readable chronological overview and analysis of Pissarro's substantial output, while the later chapters address specific genres: figures, harvest, and market scenes; late landscapes; travels and series campaigns; and interiors, still lifes, and portraits. Chapter end notes, a selected bibliography with recent references, and a good index conclude the work. A fine companion to John Rewald's Camille Pissarro (1963), this is warmly recommended for art collections in all types of libraries.<br><i>- P.

Wise and funny, with a dry wit allied to a great emotional sympathy.&#39; Sunday Times &#39;Elegant, perceptive and humane.&#39; Joanna Trollope, Books of the Year, Observer &#39;Fitzgerald, who died in 2000, was a very English novelist -- quiet, restrained, precise. She admired those who eschewed &#34;making too much of things,&#34; and her ideals were of the sort that, as she discerned, George Eliot esteemed: &#34;work, steadiness, harmony, peace.&#34; The editors of this unusually intelligent and sensitively selected collection of her criticism have chosen mainly those pieces that explore the authors of the &#34;books of her heart&#34; -- mostly minor, often overlooked writers who were, as she lovingly describes E. M. Delafield, &#34;accurate, calm, and lucid,&#34; and who composed books that could be considered &#34;somber&#34; if they &#34;were less witty, and less deceptively mild.&#34; Taken as a whole, Fitzgerald&#39;s pieces on Delafield, Sylvia Townsend Warner, the Punch writers, Mrs. Oliphant (who excelled at what she called the &#34;tragi-farce,&#34; a form Fitzgerald clearly loved), J. L. Carr, and Barbara Pym define a writerly sensibility of which Fitzgerald herself was, sadly, among the last adherents. This book is worth its price just for Fitzgerald&#39;s spot-on description of Pym&#39;s mordant vision of the distance between the sexes: &#34;If men are less than angels, Barbara Pym&#39;s men are less than men, not wanting much more than constant attention and comfort. Their theses must be typed ... endless dinners cooked, remarks listened to ... and the forces of nature and society combine to ensure, even in the 1980s, that they get these things. Women see through them clearly enough, but are drawn toward them by their own need and a compassion which is entirely taken for granted.&#34;&#39; Benjamin Schwartz, The Atlantic</p><h2>Developing Agility and Quickness (NSCA Sport Performance)</h2><p><p> The ball handler who fakes and then drives past a defender for an easy score.

He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Pulp</em>.</p><p><strong>Abel Debritto</strong>, a former Fulbright scholar and current Marie Curie fellow, works in the digital humanities. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p>Just when you think you've had enough Bukowski, there is more, and if his sixth posthumous collection, <i>Open All Night</i> [BKL D 1 00], seemed to scrape the bottom of the barrel, the eighth (a book of letters was seventh) hints that there are diamonds in the dregs. Remarkably, many of these poems--try the three on living in San Pedro, California, that open the book's fourth section--are as funny as Buk could get, and all are better written than the worst in <i>Open</i>. The barfly's stoicism and the woozy sentimentality that goes with it are here in good measure, but married to so many vignettes of living ridiculously that they amount to just so many maraschino cherries in so many whiskey sours. Bukowski's brand of that twentieth-century staple, personal poetry, defies good imitation and may have influenced performance comedy, such as the movies of Jim Jarmusch and the antics of <i>Saturday Night </i>Live and its bluer cable spawn, more than other poetry. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Into this terrifying grey world comes McMurphy, a brawling gambling man, who wages total war on behalf of his cowed fellow-inmates. What follows is at once hilarious and heroic, tragic and ultimately liberating. Since its first publication in 1962, Ken Kesey&#39;s astonishing first novel has achieved the status of a contemporary classic.</p><p>An international bestseller, Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest defined the 1960s era of ever-widening perspectives and ominous repressive forces. Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p>KEN KESEY was born in 1935 in Colorado and grew up in Oregon.

The plane was just high enough for the landscape to have a postcard quality to it, but the wind rushing in through the open hatch distracted the young woman clutching the safety strap so that all she could see was the vast expanse of sky beneath them. The man standing behind her was telling her to jump.<br><br>"What if my parachute doesn't open?" she said, glancing over her shoulder at him with a look of terror. She was a tall, beautiful blonde with a gorgeous body and exquisite face. Her eyes were huge with fear.<br><br>"Trust me, Belinda, it will open," Blake Williams promised her with a look of total confidence. Skydiving had been one of his many passions for years. And it was always a joy for him to share the wonders of it with someone else.<br><br>Belinda had agreed to it the week before, over drinks in a very prestigious private nightclub in South Beach. The following day, Blake had paid for eight hours of instruction for her and a test jump with the instructors. Belinda was ready for him now. It was only their third date, and Blake had made skydiving sound so enticing that after her second cosmopolitan, she had laughingly said yes to the invitation to skydive with him. She didn't realize what she was getting into, and she still looked nervous now, and wondered how she had let him talk her into it. The first time she'd jumped, with the two instructors he'd arranged, had scared her to death, but it was exciting too. And jumping with Blake would be the ultimate experience. She could hardly wait. He was so charming, so handsome, so outrageous, and so much fun that even though she barely knew him, she was ready to follow him and try almost anything in his company, even stepping out of a plane. But now she was terrified again, as he turned her face toward him and kissed her. The sheer thrill of being in his presence made the jump easier for her. Just as she had been taught in her lesson, she stepped out of the plane.<br><br>Blake followed her within seconds. She squeezed her eyes shut and screamed as they free-fell for a minute, and then she opened her eyes and saw him as he gestured to her to pull the ripcord on her parachute, just as the instructors had taught her to do. Suddenly they were drifting slowly to earth as he smiled at her and gave her a proud thumbs-up. She couldn't believe she'd done it twice in one week, but he was that kind of charismatic person. Blake could make people do almost anything.<br>Belinda was twenty-two years old, a supermodel in Paris, London, and New York. She had met Blake while visiting friends in Miami. He had flown in from his house in St. Bart's to meet up with a pal of his own, and had arrived in his new 737. He had chartered the smaller plane and a pilot for their jump.<br><br>Blake Williams appeared to be an expert at everything he did. He was an Olympic Class skier and had been since college, had learned to fly his own jet, with a copilot in attendance, given its size and complexity. And he had been skydiving for years. He had an extraordinary knowledge of art, and one of the most famous collections of contemporary and pre-Columbian art in the world. He was knowledgeable in wines, architecture, sailing, and women. He loved the finest things in life, and enjoyed sharing them with the women he went out with. He had an MBA from Harvard, an undergraduate degree from Princeton; he was forty-six years old, had retired at thirty-five, and his entire life was devoted to self-indulgence and pleasure, and sharing them with those around him. He was generous beyond belief, as Belinda's friends had told her. He was the kind of man every woman wanted to be with-rich, smart, good looking, and devoted to having fun. And in spite of his enormous success before he retired, he didn't have a mean bone in his body. He was the catch of the century, and although most of his relationships in the last five years had been brief and superficial, they never ended badly. Even when their fleeting affairs with him were over, women loved him. And as they floated slowly down to a well-chosen strip of unpopulated beach, Belinda looked at him with eyes filled with admiration. She couldn't believe she had jumped out of a plane with him, but it had been the most exciting thing she'd ever done. She didn't think she'd do it again, but as they held hands in midair with the blue sky all around them, she knew she would remember Blake and this moment for the rest of her life.<br><br>"It's fun, isn't it?" he shouted, and she nodded. She was still too overwhelmed to speak. Her jump with Blake had been much more exciting than the one with the two instructors days before. And she couldn't wait to tell everyone she knew what she'd done, especially with whom.<br><br>Blake Williams was everything people said he was. He had enough charm to run a country, and the money with which to do it. Despite her initial terror, Belinda was actually smiling when her feet touched the ground a few minutes later, and two waiting instructors unhooked her parachute, just as Blake landed a few feet behind her. As soon as they were free of their parachutes, he had her in his arms and kissed her again. His kisses were as intoxicating as everything else about him.<br>"You were fantastic!" he said, sweeping her off the ground, as she grinned and laughed in his arms. He was the most exciting man she'd ever met.<br><br>"No, you are! I never thought I'd do something like that, it was the craziest thing ever." She'd only known him for a week.<br><br>Her friends had already told her not to plan on having a serious relationship with him. Blake Williams went out with beautiful women all over the world. Commitment was not for him, although it had been once upon a time. He had three kids, an ex-wife he said he was crazy about, a plane, a boat, half a dozen fabulous houses. He just wanted to have a good time, and made no pretense of wanting to settle down, since his divorce. For the time being anyway, all he wanted to do was play. His early killing in the high-tech dot-com world had been legendary, as had been the success of the companies he'd invested in since. Blake Williams had everything he wanted, all his dreams had already come true. And as they walked away from the beach where they'd landed, toward a waiting Jeep, Blake put an arm around Belinda, drew her closer to him, and gave her a long, searing kiss. It was a day and a moment that Belinda knew would be engraved in her mind forever. How many women could boast that they had jumped out of a plane with Blake Williams? Possibly more than she knew, although not every woman he went out with was as brave as Belinda.<br>***<br><br>The rain pelted against the windows of Maxine Williams's office on East 79th Street in New York. It was the highest recorded rainfall in New York in November for more than fifty years, and cold, windy, and bleak outside, but cozy in the office where Maxine spent ten or twelve hours a day. The walls were painted a pale buttery yellow, and she had quiet abstract paintings on the walls in muted tones. The room was cheerful and pleasant, and the big overstuffed easy chairs where she sat talking to her patients were comfortable and inviting, and upholstered in a neutral beige. The desk was modern, stark, and functional, and so impeccably organized it looked as though you could perform surgery on it. Everything about Maxine's office was tidy and meticulous, and she herself was perfectly groomed without a hair out of place. Maxine had her entire world in full control. And her equally efficient, reliable secretary, Felicia, had worked for her for almost nine years. Maxine hated mess, disorder of any kind, and change. Everything about her, and her life, was smooth, orderly, and seamless.<br><br>The diploma framed on her wall said that she had gone to Harvard Medical School and graduated magna cum laude. She was a psychiatrist, and one of the foremost experts in trauma in both children and adolescents. She had extensive experience with schizophrenic and bipolar adolescents, and one of her subspecialties was suicidal teenagers. She worked with them and their families, often with excellent results. She had written two highly respected books for laymen, about the effect of trauma on young children. She was frequently invited to other cities and countries to consult after natural disasters, or man-made tragedies. She had been part of the consulting team for the children in Columbine after the school shooting, had written several papers on the effects of 9/11, and had advised the New York public schools. At forty-two, she was an expert in her field, and appropriately admired and acknowledged by her peers. She turned down more speaking engagements than she accepted. Between her patients, the consulting she did with local, national, and international agencies, and her own family, her days and calendar were filled.<br><br>She was always incredibly diligent about spending time with her own children-Daphne was thirteen, Jack twelve, and Sam had just turned six. As a single mother, she faced the same dilemma as every working mother, trying to balance her family responsibilities and her work. And she got almost no help from her ex, who usually appeared like a rainbow, unannounced and breathtaking, only to disappear again. All the responsibilities relating to her children fell to her, and her alone.<br><br>She sat staring out the window, thinking about them, waiting for her next patient to arrive, when the intercom buzzed on her desk. Maxine expected Felicia to tell her that her patient, a fifteen-year-old boy, was coming through the door. Instead she said that Maxine's husband was on the phone. Maxine frowned at the word.<br><br>"My ex-husband," she reminded her. Maxine and the kids had been on their own for five years, and as far as she was concerned, they were doing fine.<br><br>"Sorry, he always says he's your husband . . . I forget . . ." He was so likable and charming, and always asked about her boyfriend and her dog. He was one of those people you couldn't help but like.<br><br>"Don't worry, he forgets too," Maxine commented drily, and smiled as she picked up the phone. She wondered where he was now. You never knew with Blake. It had been four months since he'd seen the kids. He had taken them to visit friends in Greece in July, and he always loaned Maxine and the children his boat every summer. The children loved their father, but they also knew that they could count on their mom, and that their dad came and went like the wind. Maxine was well aware that they seemed to have an unlimited capacity for forgiving him his quirks. And so had she, for ten years. But eventually his total self-indulgence and lack of responsibility had worn thin despite his charm. "Hi, Blake," she said into the phone, and relaxed in her chair. The professional distance and demeanor she kept always vanished when she talked to him. In spite of the divorce, they were good friends, and had stayed very close. "Where are you now?"<br><br>"Washington, D.C. I just came up from Miami today. I was in St. Bart's for a couple of weeks." A vision of their house there came instantly into her head. She hadn't seen it in five years. It was one of the many properties she had willingly relinquished to him in the divorce.<br><br>"Are you coming to New York to see the kids?" She didn't want to tell him that he should. He knew it as well as she did, but he always seemed to have something else to do. Most of the time anyway. Much as he loved them, and always had, they got short shrift, and they knew it too. And yet they all loved him, and in her own way, she did too. There seemed to be no one on the planet who didn't love him, or at least like him. Blake had no enemies, only friends.<br><br>"I wish I could come to see them," he said apologetically. "I'm leaving for London tonight. I've got a meeting with an architect there tomorrow. I'm redoing the house." And then he added, sounding like a mischievous child himself, "I just bought a fantastic place in Marrakech. I'm flying there next week. It's an absolutely gorgeous, crumbling palace."<br><br>"Just what you need," she said, shaking her head. He was impossible. He bought houses everywhere he went. He remodeled them with famous architects and designers, turned them into showplaces, and then bought something else. Blake loved the project even more than the end result.<br><br>He had a house in London, one in St. Bart's, another in Aspen, the top half of a palazzo in Venice, a penthouse in New York, and now apparently a house in Marrakech. Maxine couldn't help wondering what he was going to do with that. But whatever he did, she knew it would be as amazing as everything else he touched. He had incredible taste, and bold ideas about design. All his homes were exquisite, and he owned one of the largest sailboats in the world, although he only used it a few weeks a year, and lent it to friends whenever he could. The rest of the time he was flying around the world, on safari in Africa, or making art forays in Asia. He'd been to Antarctica twice and came back with stunning photographs of icebergs and penguins. His world had long since outgrown hers. She was content with her predictable, well-regulated life in New York, between her office and the comfortable apartment where she lived with their three children, on Park Avenue and East 84th Street. She walked home from her office every night, even on a day like this. The short walk revived her after the hard things she listened to all day, and the troubled kids she treated. Other psychiatrists often referred their potential suicides to her. Dealing with difficult cases was her way of giving to the world, and she loved her work.<br><br>"So Max, how's by you? How are the kids?" Blake asked, sounding relaxed.<br><br>"They're fine. Jack's playing soccer again this year, he's gotten pretty good," she said with pride. It was like telling Blake about someone else's children. He was more like their favorite uncle than their father. The trouble was, he had been that way as a husband too. Irresistible in every way, and never there when there was something hard to do.</p><h2>Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology</h2><p>Is a thoroughly Christian and biblically informed doctrine of creation compatible with widely held conclusions of modern science, especially biology? For Darrel R. Falk, this is not just an abstract question but one with which he has personally wrestled. A professor of biology, Falk brings together his biblically based understanding of creation and the most current research in biology. The result of his efforts to acknowledge the validity of science and the authority of Scripture is a new paradigm for relating the claims of science to the truths of Christianity. Written with the undergraduate student in mind, this book nonetheless will help anyone who is looking for a place to stand in the creation-evolution debate, fearful that they&#39;ll have to choose between intellectual integrity and the faith of the church. Calling for charitable discussions within the church, Falk shows how an original and ongoing interaction of God with creation is fully reconcilable with the kinds of development identified by current biological science.</p><p>Falk is professor of biology, associate provost, and dean of graduate studies and continuing education at Point Loma Nazarene University in Point Loma, California."In this highly instructive book, Darrel Falk describes his intellectual and spiritual journey in reconciling Christian belief with biological evolution. It is important for the wider body of Christians, many of whom remain skeptical of biological evolution, to grapple with the arguments contained in this book. This book promises to start a real conversation about the role of evolution in relation to the Christian faith, a conversation in which all parties to the creation-evolution debate feel welcome to participate, speak their minds freely and can put forward their best efforts." (William A. Dembski, author of The Design Revolution)<br><br>"There is much good news within these pages. Skeptics of science can be reassured that life makes sense and that the methods of science can be trusted. Those fearful that science requires a descent into atheism will be reassured by the vibrant Christian spirituality evidenced in Falk's narrative." (From the foreword by Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Physician, Geneticist and Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH))<br><br>"Books on creation typically suggest that either God or the scientific community actively delude humankind. Falk's book offers a breath of fresh air to those who believe that the God of the Bible is the source of all truth. Passionate in his faith, certain that the Scriptures and science can stand careful scrutiny, Falk carefully integrates the evidence to build a picture of the loving creator-God. Needed for so long, this powerful book can intellectually and spiritually nourish the Christian community." (Philip Batterham, Associate Professor, Department of Genetics, University of Melbourne)<br><br>"Darrel Falk is a skilled educator and pastoral writer. Theologically sound, scientifically accurate, understandable at the high school and early college science level, this is a superb book for evangelicals and other Christians who want to learn about the history of life that God is revealing to us in the book of his creation." (Loren Haarsma, Assistant Professor of Physics, Calvin College)<br><br><em>"Coming to Peace with Science</em> is a well-informed and very personal look at evolution by a biologist and committed evangelical Christian. It is written in an understandable and sensitive way that honors both the scientific vocation and the authority of scripture. The book is a refreshing contrast to much popular Christian writing on evolution. In it, Darrel Falk embraces and rejoices in both the biblical message and the history and processes of creation as revealed by scientific investigation. He also makes a strong and personal appeal for peace--not only between science and faith but also among committed believers who have come to different conclusions with regard to the creation's formational history." (Keith B. Miller, research assistant professor of geology at Kansas State University, fellow of the American Scientific Affiliation, and editor of Perspectives on an Evolving Creation)<br><br>"Professor Falk's <em>Coming to Peace with Science</em> is the most informed, thoughtful and spiritually sensitive look at 'creation through the eyes of a biologist' that I have ever read. Falk knows firsthand just how hard it can be for an evangelical raised on the Bible to make peace with the theory of evolution. As a respected biologist who takes the Bible very seriously he knows, however, that this peace must be found. <em>Coming to Peace with Science</em> will be an effective bridge between science and religion for years to come." (Karl Giberson, Ph.D., Professor of Physics, Eastern Nazarene College, Editor in Chief, Science Spirit, Editor, Research News Opportunities in Science Theology)</p><h2>Silvermist and the Ladybug Curse (Disney Fairies)</h2><p>NOTHING RATTLES SILVERMIST.

In this fourth volume of Johnstone's Eagles series, Jamie, patriarch of the hugely prolific clan that runs Valley, Colo., acts as little more than a Dirty Harry in buckskins, as likely to slaughter historical fact as he is to off his fellow humans. After his beloved wife is murdered by the Miles Nelson gang of cutthroats and robbers, Jamie vows to track down and kill every one of the cowardly outlaws. At 62, the frontiersman is as tough as a boiled owl, spry and still handy with his pistols, rifle and shotgun.Wasting no time, he wipes out the gang and, through a maze of poorly defined subplots, also pumps lead into bounty hunters, feuding families, crooked lawmen, hired assassins and several hapless smart alecks. Jamie even finds time to fight the Sioux with General Custer, miraculously surviving the Last Stand. This is a preposterous story, with little historical accuracy or value, featuring a shallow caricature of a western hero. Readers may note that Jamie never confronts Miles Nelson himself, no doubt saving the outlaw for a further bloodbath?though one wonders if it could possibly be as mindless as this. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Dangerous Promise (Orphan Train Adventures, Book 4) (The Orphan Train Adventures)</h2><p>In 1861, motivated by dreams of glory on the battlefield, young Mike Kelly joins the Union Army as a drummer boy, only to discover the true horrors of war during the bloody Battle of Wilson&#39;s Creek.</p><p>Joan Lowery Nixon was the author of more than 130 books for young readers and was the only four-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Best Young Adult Mystery Award.

As musicians in the Second Kansas Infantry, they make a long and difficult march into Missouri, where they encounter General McCulloch's Missouri Guard at the arduous Battle of Wilson's Creek. Mike is wounded and left for dead; Todd is brutally killed. Mike looks on in agony while a man takes an heirloom pocket watch from his friend's body-he'd promised Todd he'd return it to his sister if anything ever happened to him.

I believe we&#x2019;ve met before.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m Tiger Brooks, the guy who travels with his friend Luna Lopez through a magical picture frame into great works of art. I suppose you know that our time travels only happen during the hour of power. At four o&#x2019;clock, we get sucked into a painting, and if we&#x2019;re not back where we started at exactly five o&#x2019;clock, we&#x2019;re stuck in the world of art forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s right, I said <i>forever</i>, as in F-O-R-E-V-E-R. There&#x2019;s no coming back. It&#x2019;s not like you can call a friend and say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready to come home now.&#x201d; The one thing I&#x2019;ve learned about the world of art is that the cell phone reception there seriously stinks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our magical picture frame is located in our neighbor Viola Dots&#x2019;s house. It pulled her son, David, right out of her living room fifty years ago, and she&#x2019;s been searching for him in paintings ever since. Luna and I have been trying to help her find him. Don&#x2019;t ask me how this crazy frame got to be so magical. I don&#x2019;t have a clue. But I can tell you that traveling through it is a fantastic adventure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let me warn you, the adventure I&#x2019;m going to tell you about is different from the ones before. It has, as my grandma always says, a completely new wrinkle. It&#x2019;s funny that my grandma loves that expression, because the last thing she needs is a new wrinkle. She already has about a million of them. She even has some on her knees, but don&#x2019;t tell her I told you.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know you&#x2019;re not reading this to learn about knee wrinkles.

As for me, I&#x2019;ll be waiting for you at the end.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Everything in the world was just right. It was Sunday afternoon, a soft breeze was coming through the open window, and I was at my favorite place in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> My invention desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s just a regular desk, but it&#x2019;s where I work my magic. My desk is packed with all my tools, like my voltage meter and my ten-piece screwdriver kit. And I rigged up a set of containers to store all my tiny screws, washers and nuts, copper wires, microchips, and, of course, more tiny screws.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s no place I&#x2019;d rather be than sitting at my invention desk, squinting at a circuit board. It was especially great that Sunday because my chatterbox of a little sister, Maggie, was outside trying to earn some money at her lemonade stand.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was all set to begin work on my latest invention, something I call the Pocket Buddy. It&#x2019;s a super-duper all-in-one tool featuring a pair of scissors, a spork, a mini magnifying glass, a little pen, and a breath-mint dispenser. Suddenly, my mom burst through the door without knocking. I hadn&#x2019;t even heard her footsteps coming down the hall. She&#x2019;d probably taken off her shoes so she could surprise me. Moms are sneaky that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger, Maggie needs your help,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you read the sign on my door?&#x201d; I shot back. &#x201c;No parents without prior appointment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that Cooper Starr kid,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s his little brother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean Pooch?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That sounds like a dog&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what everyone calls Andrew Starr,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;That kid&#x2019;s as bad as his big brother. On Friday at school, I saw him put someone&#x2019;s lunch box in the trash can. That&#x2019;s his idea of fun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it looks like Cooper and Pooch are trying to run Maggie out of business,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;She needs your help.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you help her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger, you know it&#x2019;s embarrassing to have your mom stick up for you. It&#x2019;s much cooler when your older brother does. So I&#x2019;d like you to go outside and see what you can do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I couldn&#x2019;t believe my ears. First, my mom burst into my room and interrupted my precious invention time. Now she was ordering me to help my little sister fight a lemonade-stand war against the Starr brothers, the biggest jerks this side of Mars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the first thing about lemonade stands,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;or even how to make lemonade. It&#x2019;s made from grapefruit, correct?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very clever, Einstein,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mom, do you think Thomas Edison&#x2019;s mother asked him to help his little sister when he was right in the middle of inventing the lightbulb?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First of all, you&#x2019;re not inventing the lightbulb. And second, Maggie needs help now. She wants to raise ten dollars by five o&#x2019;clock so she can go to the mall with her friend Hazel&#x2019;s family to buy a Shop-Cool doll.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sighed loud and long, and I let it hang in the air for a while. Oh sure, I could think of more comebacks, throw a tantrum, come down with a case of yellow fever&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but in the end, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter. My mom would win.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Knock knock&#x201d; came a friendly voice from the hallway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna, my upstairs neighbor, poked her head into my room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I heard your conversation from the porch,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d love to help Maggie, Mrs. Brooks. My grandma always says nothing is more important than family.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about minding your own business?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t your grandma believe in that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Luna said with a laugh. &#x201c;Now, what are you waiting for, Tiger? We have lemonade to sell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sighed again. Luna is my best friend, but she might be a little too nice for this world.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, Tiger?&#x201d; my mom said, her hands on her hips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, Tiger?&#x201d; Luna repeated, her hands on her hips, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was too many hands on hips for me. I buckled under the pressure. I put away my tiny screws and headed outside.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seemed like the world was just going to have to wait one more day for the Pocket Buddy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Luna and I stepped out of our duplex into a perfect Los Angeles day. Well, it had been perfect before everyone decided I had to go into the lemonade-selling, sister-saving business.<br> &nbsp;<br> I checked the time on my Batman watch. After I&#x2019;d left the first one behind on one of my fantastic frame journeys, my uncle Cole gave me the one off his own wrist. What a great uncle. I hope you have your own version of Uncle Cole.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to Batman, it was 2:24 p.m.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make this quick,&#x201d; I said to Luna. &#x201c;Maybe I can still work on my invention before the hour of power.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not until four o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Luna said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Viola said she wanted us to be there early today,&#x201d; I reminded her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, right. She told us that this week&#x2019;s art adventure is really important.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wonder what that&#x2019;s supposed to mean,&#x201d; I said as we headed down the driveway to the sidewalk.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was ready to be annoyed with Maggie, but that changed when I saw her sad little lemonade stand. She was just sitting by the table, with a pitcher of gray-looking lemonade and a stack of paper cups in front of her. There was also a fishbowl she was using to hold the money. Only there was no money in it. I really felt bad for her when I saw her wiping tears from her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dunnn-da-da-daaaaa,&#x201d; Luna sang. &#x201c;We have come to save the day!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Maggie said, pretending as if she hadn&#x2019;t been crying. &#x201c;Do you want to buy a cup of lemonade?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I said, swishing around the icky-looking lemonade with a spoon.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d clearly made the stuff herself. I don&#x2019;t know how much experience you&#x2019;ve had with five-year-olds, but you don&#x2019;t want to taste any drink they&#x2019;ve made with their own grubby hands. Their drinks usually contain a secret ingredient, and that secret ingredient is never something you should swallow, such as tiny bits of shredded paper or a spoonful of mud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to help you get some customers for your lemonade stand,&#x201d; Luna said, &#x201c;so you can buy the toy you want.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Maggie&#x2019;s eyes lit up. &#x201c;Shop-Cool dolls are my favorite.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First things first,&#x201d; Luna said to Maggie. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s test your lemonade.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She poured herself a cup of lemonade and brought it to her lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I yelled, but it was too late.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stuff was already in Luna&#x2019;s mouth. I watched as she swallowed, grabbed her neck, and tried not to throw up. Her eyes watered, and her entire mouth turned into a pucker.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;Something tells me you made it yourself?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy squeezed the lemons, and I added the secret ingredients,&#x201d; Maggie confessed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Luna said. She dipped her finger into the cup and pulled out some crumpled-up dead leaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t put those leaves in it,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;It was that mean boy, Pooch. And then he set up his stand right on our street.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked down the block and saw the competition. There were quite a few people at Pooch&#x2019;s stand. He had a great sign and bags of ice, and I could see cartons of ready-made lemonade on his table. It was that sugar drink called Marty&#x2019;s Lem-O that&#x2019;s not really even lemonade. Maggie and I aren&#x2019;t allowed to drink it because Mom says it would make our teeth fall out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Helping Pooch was his horrible big brother, Cooper Starr. He calls himself Super Cooper, but Luna and I think his nickname should be World&#x2019;s Number One Creep. He&#x2019;s mean, and that&#x2019;s on a good day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to make some new lemonade,&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;And no offense, Maggie, but maybe we should try a different recipe. Tiger, why don&#x2019;t you go grab lemons from the tree in the backyard? I&#x2019;ll get some sugar and supplies from my house.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The low-hanging lemons had already been picked, so I had to use a fruit picker to get to the lemons on the top branches.<br> &nbsp;<br> I picked at least fifteen lemons and took them to our porch. Then I had to squeeze them. That was hard. You don&#x2019;t actually squeeze very much juice from each lemon, and when you finally get some, you have to get a strainer to fish out all the seeds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then it hit me. I had invented a solution for this lemon-squeezing problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Pocket Buddy! I had two perfectly good Pocket Buddy prototypes on my desk. (A <i>prototype</i> is what we inventor types call the early model of something we make.) I ran to my room and grabbed them both, then met Luna back on the porch. She had brought water, sugar, and a plastic pitcher from her kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; she asked when I handed her one of the prototypes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The newest and best time-saving device ever invented,&#x201d; I bragged.<br> &nbsp;<br> I showed her how to use the scissors to cut the lemons into wedges, and the sporks to remove the seeds that were floating in the juice. I had even installed a tiny FM radio on my newest prototype. I pulled out the antenna, and we listened to a couple of tunes while we finished the lemonade.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the pitcher was full, we hurried over to Maggie&#x2019;s stand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good news, Mags,&#x201d; I said, putting the pitcher on the table. &#x201c;Now we have something great that you can sell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All we have to do is advertise our product,&#x201d; Luna said.<br> &nbsp;<br> She ran into her house and came back with a piece of poster board and colorful markers. Luna collects art supplies the way I collect screws, bolts, and circuit boards.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to make you a big sign,&#x201d; Luna told Maggie. &#x201c;First, we need a catchy name for your stand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How about Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy?&#x201d; I suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna burst out laughing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I want my name on the sign,&#x201d; Maggie said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, how about Lil&#x2019; Maggie&#x2019;s Handmade Lemonade?&#x201d; Luna said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not little,&#x201d; Maggie protested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m big.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna made a colorful sign that said big maggie&#x2019;s handmade lemonade and stood it up on the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> At 3:41 p.m., according to my Batman watch, we officially reopened for business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our first customer was metal-mouthed Cooper Starr, the king of jerkdom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take one cup of snot juice, if you please,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughed like he had just told the funniest joke in the whole world. He waited while Maggie poured a cup. Her eyes nearly bugged out of her head when he slapped a ten-dollar bill down on the table. &#x201c;Can you make change for a tenner?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course we couldn&#x2019;t, but Maggie tried to figure it out, anyway, counting to ten on her fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only babies count on their fingers,&#x201d; he snorted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does it make you feel good to tease a five-year-old?&#x201d; Luna asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You bet it does,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;This pipsqueak needs to close up shop right now. My brother, Pooch, runs the lemonade business on this street.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cooper put the ten-dollar bill back into his pocket, grabbed a handful of grass from the lawn, and was just about to drop it into our lemonade. He stopped when we heard a horn honking and saw a big white van rumbling down the street toward us. On its side, in large red letters, it said los angeles hospital.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cooper, your ride to the hospital for mutant research is here,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The medical van pulled up in front of Viola Dots&#x2019;s house. The back doors swung open, and two emergency medical team members got out in a hurry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watch out, kids,&#x201d; they hollered as they lifted a wheelchair from the van. &#x201c;We got a sick lady coming through.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As they lowered the wheelchair onto the ground, I saw an old woman sitting in it. I gasped. It was none other than Viola Dots herself.</p><h2>Mr Pye</h2><p><p>Equipped with love, Mr Harold Pye lands on the island of Sark, his mission to convert the islanders into a crusading force for the undiluted goodness that he feels within.

In 1919, he joined the Communist Party and served in the ill-fated revolutionary government of B�la Kun, which collapsed before the end of the year. For much of the next fifteen years he lived in exile, returning to Hungary for good in 1935. Though initially well-regarded by Hungary&#x2019;s post&#x2013;World War II Communist government, by 1953 D�ry had been expelled from the party for his criticism of its increasingly repressive policies. He then supported Imre Nagy&#x2019;s reformist government and, after the Soviet suppression of the 1956 uprising, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Writers around the world (including Camus, Sartre, E.M. Forster, Rebecca West, and Alberto Moravia) rallied on his behalf, and in 1960 D�ry was not only granted amnesty but allowed to publish and travel in relative freedom.

From the early attempts with zoetropes, praxinoscopes, and kineographs to the eloquent special effects of Beauty and the Beast , the achievements of the Disney company are traced. Thomas explores the animation process with an informative history, accompanied by interviews ; the behind-the-scenes work on story lines; and production processes. The innovative and visionary Walt is profiled, from his early shaky enterprise with his brother Roy to their commercial success with Mickey Mouse. Both familiar and new cartoon characters appear in this chronological study. The second section is devoted to Beauty and the Beast , tracing the legend through the storyboard process to the final product. Full-page, full-color illustrations, examples of story sketches, layouts, drawings, and photographs further enhance this volume, making it far more entertaining than the biographies by Barbara Ford (Walker, 1989) and Katherine and Richard Greene (Viking, 1991). --Judie Porter, Media Services Center, Portsmouth School Department, RI Grades 3-6<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book is really two volumes in one. The first volume updates the author's earlier publication Walt Disney: The Art of Animation ( LJ 3/1/59), tracing the evolution of the Disney Studio's animated features up through the release of the recent Rescuers Down Under . The second volume showcases all the processes involved in crafting Disney's newest feature, Beauty and the Beast . As a veteran Disney watcher, Thomas used his entre into the Disney archives to choose the book's 200 color illustrations, set off by a lenticular cover. He also interviewed key creative personnel at Disney, touching on all aspects of making animated films, including conceptualization, scripting, storyboarding, artwork, character development, production, direction, acting, music, layout, animation, and special effects. Sidebar notes and drawings illustrate how characters and storylines evolve as the film moves towards completion.

I mean, he always was mostly evil anyway&#x2014;you know, knocking me down things or over things, locking me in things or out of things, squashing me under things or between things, that kind of mostly evil stuff. But lately he&#x2019;s slid up the evil scale from &#x201c;mostly evil&#x201d; to &#x201c;nearly totally evil.&#x201d; It started with the way he talked. <br>&#x201c;Hey! Tom!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Remote! Now!&#x201d; <br>Mark spoke in short words, like his brain had shrunk or something. He grabbed the remote and kicked my foot away. &#x201c;Moron,&#x201d; he mumbled. <br>My best friend, Pradeep, who lives next door, says that &#x201c;moron&#x201d; is a big-brother word for little brothers. His brother, Sanj, who&#x2019;s also mostly evil, calls him that too. Luckily Sanj is away at boarding school though, so he can only be mostly evil to Pradeep during school vacations. <br>I told my mom about Mark going more evil, but Mom said it&#x2019;s just that Mark is &#x201c;home-moanal.&#x201d; Which I think is why he&#x2019;s moaning at home a lot. She said he can&#x2019;t help acting evil (well, she didn&#x2019;t say evil exactly, but she should have). She said it&#x2019;s because he has lots of &#x201c;home-moans&#x201d; racing around his body. <br>Just when I thought Mark couldn&#x2019;t get worse, Granny and Grandad got him a chemistry set for his birthday. It came in a huge box with big official writing on the front that read: <br>WARNING! Only for use by children over twelve years old. To be used solely under the supervision of adults. <br>While I was reading the box, Mark thwacked my head from behind. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch this&#x2014;got it?&#x201d; he said. <br>I walked away rubbing my head. Mostly because it hurt, but also to get my head out of the way in case he decided to thwack me again. <br>He took out a white scientist coat and looked at all the stuff inside the box. There were bottles and test tubes and cups and little stirring things, all made of glass. Real breakable glass! Mom looked at the chemistry set and leaned over to me. <br>&#x201c;Maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t touch it, dear. It looks like an accident waiting to happen,&#x201d; she said. <br>Mark put on the coat and turned around. He folded up the collar, shoved his hands in the pockets and let a creepy smile spread over his face. And you know that squirmy, prickly feeling you get when you let a millipede crawl on your arm? I had that feeling, but in my stomach. <br>Mark had turned into an EVIL SCIENTIST. But I didn&#x2019;t know how evil he could be until he came home the next day with the goldfish. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Text copyright � 2013 by Mo O&#x2019;Hara. <br>Illustrations copyright � 2013 by Marek Jagucki <br></p><h2>Thunder Oak (The Welkin Weasels #1)</h2><p>Long before Sylver the weasel was born, the humans all left Welkin.

After working at a popular restaurant, he moved to New Hampshire to study hotel and restaurant management at college. While pursuing a career in hotels, he honed his skills in the kitchen by experimenting and creating recipes of his own.&nbsp;<br><br>Adapting his diet to improve his health, he eventually became a vegan, eschewing all animal products. But he still craved the premium dairy ice creams he once ate and so used his kitchen gifts to experiment with creating a rich, gourmet vegan ice cream. As he became interested in the raw food movement, he also began to make ice creams with all raw ingredients.<br><br>Soon after beginning his vegan ice cream venture, Jeff began sharing his desserts with friends. A physician friend noted that in a world where people are trying to eat low-fat foods and fewer sweets, it was naughty of Jeff to create these decadent desserts, vegan or not. Thus, he was dubbed &#x201c;The Naughty Vegan&#x201d; and has used the nickname ever since.&nbsp;<br><br>Jeff has volunteered for and done pro bono work for animal rights, vegan, and raw food groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA), Northwest Animal Rights Network (NARN), Farm Sanctuary, the Gentle Barn, Raw Network of Washington, and EarthSave.

Over the years,&nbsp; I experimented with my diet and discovered the effect of foods on my overall health. While moving toward a plant-based diet, I reduced (and later eliminated) my migraine headaches, and my high blood pressure returned to normal.&nbsp; I also had far fewer colds and fewer instances of the flu. Their severity and duration were also much less. After&nbsp; I discovered the benefits of a vegan diet, I found that the vegan &#x201c;ice creams&#x201d; on the market were simply not satisfying; they were not rich enough for me, and I did not enjoy the aftertaste.<br><br> Since there are many people who cannot eat dairy and many more who choose not to for ethical, environmental, and health reasons, I wanted to create a wonderful ice cream alternative. For those who were already vegans, this would add a new dessert to their diets. For others, it would allow them to give up the dairy they had been wanting to do without.<br><br> I thought that there must be a way of making a rich,&nbsp; flavorful vegan ice cream that would easily satisfy the expectations I had developed when I ate dairy. Having used cashew milk to replace cow&#x2019;s milk and cream in other recipes, I realized that was how I should make my homemade vegan ice cream. In 1999, I moved to Seattle, purchased&nbsp; an ice cream maker, and began experimenting with vegan ice creams. The results were as rich as I wanted them to be.&nbsp; A luscious, homemade vegan ice cream was finally born!<br><br> I began sharing these ice creams at local EarthSave potlucks and at other EarthSave chapters in cities like Vancouver, Canada; Portland, Oregon; and San Diego, California, as well as at WorldFest in Los Angeles. I soon had many people asking for my recipes or for the ice cream itself. Over time, I&#x2019;ve traveled to many vegan, raw, and health food shows to demonstrate how delicious vegan ice cream can be and how easy it is to make. Sharing this healthful alternative to dairy ice cream has become part of my life&#x2019;s work. In the years since I first started making vegan ice creams, veganism has become much more popular. Vegan products have become more available in stores and online, plus vegan options at restaurants have greatly increased. <br><br> I soon realized that I&#x2019;d rather distribute my recipes widely than produce vegan ice cream commercially, because using organic cashews, the base for many of the recipes, is rather expensive, and allowing people to make vegan ice cream themselves would make it more affordable. I believe that these recipes will make a difference in people&#x2019;s lives. <br> I certainly hope they succeed in doing so.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; ------------------------------<br><br> This bright and fresh flavor wakes up the taste buds and instantly calls to mind childhood mornings drinking Concord grape juice along with breakfast. The creamy texture and flavor of cashews provides a subtle backdrop to the fruity burst of grape.<br><br><b> Concord Grape<br></b>Makes about 1 quart<br><br> 2-1&#x2044;4 pounds organic Concord grapes<br> 1 cup raw organic cashews or cashew pieces<br> 1&#x2044;2 cup packed organic pitted honey dates<br><br> Run the grapes through a juicer to make 3 cups juice.<br><br> Combine the grape juice and cashews in a blender. Blend until smooth. With the motor running, gradually add the dates and blend on high until silky smooth, at least 1 minute.<br><br> Place the blender in the freezer for 40 minutes to 1 hour or in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight, until well chilled. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Serve immediately or transfer to airtight containers and store in the freezer until ready to serve.<br> &nbsp;<br></p><h2>Secret Pilgrim</h2><p>Ned is the Secret Pilgrim, a loyal soldier of the Cold War, who has been in British Intelligence all his adult life.

She has been profiled on Entertainment Tonight, CNN, and other national news programs; her on-target psychic readings have helped police solve crimes; and she astounds audiences wherever she appears. Sylvia is the NY Times bestselling author of many books including: Sylvia Browne&#x2019;s Book of Angels HC &amp; TR, ISBN&#x2019;s: 1-4019-0084-4 &amp; 1-4019-0193X with over 200K in sales; Sylvia Browne&#x2019;s Book of Dreams, sales of over 200,000, ISBN: 0525946586; and Adventures of a Psychic, with 700,000 in sales. ISBN: 1-56170-621-3. She lives in Campbell, CA.Everything from Atlantis to Bigfoot to the Bermuda Triangle is dusted off in this rambling rehash of pop mythology. Browne (Adventures of a Psychic) serves up perfunctory accounts of folktales, New Age origin myths and tabloid sensations, embellishing them with her desultory psychic vibes ("historians say that Stonehenge dates to about 3000 B.C., but I felt when I was there that it was more like 5000 B.C.") and the nattering asides&#x2014;"Francine said there are forty-four universes"&#x2014;of her "spirit guide." Influenced by Francine and theorist Erich Van Daniken, who believes astronauts existed in ancient times, Browne ascribes most unexplained phenomena to extraterrestrials from the Andromeda galaxy, who are responsible for the Pyramids (built with "anti-gravity rods"), crop circles (formed by aliens to "get their message across") and the blood-sucking Chupacabra ("a creature from another planet that was put here for research purposes and sometimes runs amok"). Browne is founder of a Gnostic-ish church (she offers a lengthy, Da Vinci Code-like chronicle of Jesus&#x2019;s life, in which he survives crucifixion and settles down with Mary Magdalene in France) and is therefore skeptical of legends associated with Catholicism, like demons, stigmata and the Shroud of Turin, all of which are accorded uncharacteristically rational explanations. With its biased pattern of credulity and debunking, the book amounts to a slapdash tour of the author&#x2019;s own eccentric belief systems.

In this collection of stories from the past decade, however, his contentious afterwords show a typical SF disdain for mainstream writing that emphasizes characters. Benford's own characters exist solely as functions of his themes, which often deal with humanity's diminutive stature in relation to aliens, astronomy, or humankind's inventions, from modern medicine to nuclear weapons. The ideas are intriguing but often difficult to decipher, and the brief afterwords are necessary to clarify Benford's intentions. Not surprisingly, his machines have more personality than his people, and the best entries ("Me/Days" and "Snatching the Bot") show artificial intelligences emerging. A weak collection from a celebrated writer. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Juice Lady&#39;s Remedies for Stress and Adrenal Fatigue: Juices, Smoothies, and Living Foods Recipes for Your Ultimate Health</h2><p><b>Don&#x2019;t let stress ruin your health.<br> Fight back with these all-natural juice remedies.</b><br> You don&#x2019;t have to suffer with the effects of stress and exhaustion.

It's not much different than the dot.com mania or the corporate scams that heat up over a century later.</p><p>Unfortunately for Joe Rose, a precious-metals assayer, death stakes its own claim. Joe's body is found trampled into the muck behind Inez Stannert's saloon. Inez already had much more to deal with than pouring shots of Taos Lightning and cleaning up a corpse. A lady educated on the East Coast, she has a past that doesn't bear close scrutiny, including her elopement with a gambling man who has recently disappeared.</p><p>Most townsfolk, including Inez's business partner, Abe Jackson, dismiss Joe's death as an accident. Death, after all, is no stranger in Leadville. But Inez wonders: Why was this loving husband and father carrying a brass token good for "one free screw" at the parlor house of Denver madam Mattie Silks?</p><p>When Joe's widow Emma asks Inez to settle Joe's affairs, almost against her will, Inez uncovers skewed assays, bogus greenbacks, and blackmail. Lies and secrets run deep in Colorado, secrets<strong> </strong>more likely to lead to a hanging than to today's congressional hearings or country-club prisons for the crooked and the greedy.

A science writer by day, Ann lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and is a member of Mystery Writers of America and Women Writing the West.Meet Inez Stannert, the poker-playing, straight-talking, gun-toting owner of the Silver Queen Saloon and the heroine of Parker's excellent debut, set in wintry Leadville, Colo., during the 1879 silver boom. Inez is married, yet her husband disappeared six months earlier with nary a trace. Her partner at the saloon, Abe Jackson, happens to be a free black man, to the dismay of much of Leadville's uptight and prejudiced populace. When a frozen corpse turns up in the mucky alley behind the saloon, Inez and Abe, still reeling from the damage caused by a barroom brawl, are shocked to learn it's their friend, precious-metals assayer Joe Rose. Joe, it seems, had a gambling problem and a nasty secret. His death puts Inez and Abe at odds with a crooked lawman, an infamous madam, a spurned suitor and the mysterious stranger who rides into town as the new minister. Drawing on historic facts and figures of 1870s Colorado, Parker tells a gripping tale of love, greed and murder in the Old West, with a cast of convincing, larger-than-life characters, including a brief appearance from Bat Masterson himself. Inez is a woman well ahead of her time and a welcome addition to the genre, as is Parker, who has left enough loose ends to beckon readers to the next Leadville mystery.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</h2><p><b>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</b> is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.</p><p></p><h2>House at Sea&#39;s End</h2><p>A team of archaeologists, investigating coastal erosion on the north Norfolk coast, unearth six bodies buried at the foot of a cliff.

Their collective effort&#x2014;first attempted by H. G. Wells in his 1893 essay "The Man of the Year Million"&#x2014;is an exploration into a barely conceivable distant future, where the authors confront far-flung possibilities, at times bordering on philosophy of science. How would the galaxy look if it were redesigned for optimal energy use and maximized intelligence? What is a universe bereft of stars?<br><br>Contributors include Amara D.

What will humans look like in another million years (if we're still around)? Where will we live and what will we be doing? In this collection, Broderick, an Australian writer and science fiction editor, and a dozen-plus contributors let their imaginations run wild. At times they sound like a bunch of dudes tossing around what if's, but they've come up with truly funky ideas. The concept of a Matrioshka brain crops up more than once&#x2014;a gigantic system of solar-orbiting structures to trap the sun's energy. Other authors stay more down to earth. Dougal Dixon speculates on continental drift and changes in the Earth's magnetic field. Steven Harris discusses why deuterium may take the place of oil and gas as our primary energy source in a few millennia. Several chapters read more like science fiction than sound scientific speculation, and a few wander off topic, but it's all great fun. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the original book, comes a picture book with a fresh and appealing commercial look just right for a new generation of dog lovers.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Hill</b> is the author of many books for children, including several My Readers and her acclaimed novel <i>Whistle in the Dark</i>. She lives in Portland, OR. <br><b>Olga and Aleksey Ivanov</b> have illustrated more than seventy books for children, including <i>Mountain Dog </i>by Margarita Engle and the My Readers about Harry Cat and Tucker Mouse.</p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Commemorating the 75th anniversary of Knight's novel, this title tenderly retells the classic story of a dog who sets the gold standard for loyalty. As in the original, Joe and his family have fallen upon hard times and must sell their beloved canine to the Duke of Rudling to make ends meet. But stalwart Lassie remains devoted to her boy, traveling more than 400 miles to find Joe again after the Duke takes her to his home in Scotland. Though Hill's simplified picture book version retains the same basic plot, it's much gentler in tone. The soft pencil and watercolor illustrations, though endearing and appropriate for this age level, depict idyllic settings that don't convey the hardscrabble existence of a Depression-era, Northern England mining town or the intensity of the dog's journey. Indeed, Lassie's long and arduous trek is condensed into a montage of upbeat images: the collie leaping spiritedly over a stream and trotting cheerfully through a field. Hill's quiet prose is elegant, but the more dramatic elements of the plot are tempered&#x2014;as is the impact of the triumphant return. VERDICT Aimed at independent readers, Rosemary Wells's illustrated adaptation (Holt, 1995) preserves the spirit of the original while using language that a modern audience will find more palatable. Still, Hill's sweet adaptation is a suitable option for those seeking to introduce this unforgettable tale.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>Art and Literature</h2><p>Incredible collection of original essays by Freud - including essays on Dostoyevsky, Goethe, Ibsen, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Shakespeare.</p><p></p><h2>Resistant: A Novel (Dr. Lou Welcome)</h2><p><p>They kill without conscience or remorse.

Cap Duncan, shirtless and already in his running shorts, was kneeling by Lou&#x2019;s feet, holding down his ankles. Cap&#x2019;s shaved pate was glistening. His grin, as usual, was like a star going nova. He had done three hundred crunches before Lou was even out of the sack, and looked like he could easily have ripped off three hundred more.</p> <p>Every inch a man&#x2019;s man.</p> <p>Lou&#x2019;s best friend, and for ten years his AA sponsor, was a fifty-two-year-old Bahamian, with a physique that looked like it had been chiseled by one of Michelangelo&#x2019;s descendants. He had earned his nickname, Cap&#x2019;n Crunch, from his days as a professional boxer, specifically from the sound noses made when he hit them.</p> <p>It was April 14&#x2014;a Thursday. Lou&#x2019;s trip to Georgia had been ordered by Walter Filstrup, the bombastic head of the Washington, D.C., Physician Wellness Office (PWO), a position that made the psychiatrist Lou&#x2019;s boss.</p> <p>Filstrup&#x2019;s sweet wife, Marjory, a polar opposite of her husband, was in the ICU of a Maryland hospital with an irregular heartbeat that had not responded to electrical cardioversion. But as one of two candidates for the presidency of the National Federation of Physician Health Programs, Filstrup was scheduled to address the annual meeting, being held this year at the lodge in the mountains north of Atlanta.</p> <p>Wife in ICU versus speech in Georgia. <i>Let&nbsp;&#x2026; me&nbsp;&#x2026; think.</i></p> <p>Not surprisingly to Lou, Filstrup had actually wrestled mightily with the choice. It wasn&#x2019;t until Marjory had an allergic reaction to one of the cardiac meds that the man turned his speech over to Lou along with his conference registration, and an expense account that would cover all Lou&#x2019;s meals, providing he only ate one a day.</p> <p>Whoopee.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re slowing down, Welcome,&#x201d; Cap said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to get to three hundred that way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to get&nbsp;&#x2026; to three hundred <i>any</i> way.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cap, his competitive fire seldom dimmed, delighted in saying that most people&#x2019;s workout was his warm-up. Lou, nine years younger, and at six feet, an inch or so taller, never had any problem believing that. Their connection began the day Lou was checked into Harbor House, a sober halfway house in one of the grittier sections of D.C. Cap, given name Hank, was working as a group leader there while he cajoled one bank after another trying to scrape together enough bread for his own training center. Twelve months after that, Lou was living on his own, the Stick and Move Gym had become a reality, and the two friends, one black as a moonless night, and the other a blue-eyed rock-jaw with the determination of a Rottweiler and roots that may have gone back to the Pilgrims, were sparring three times a week.</p> <p>A year or so after that, following a zillion recovery meetings and the development of a new, infinitely mellower philosophy of living, the suspension of Lou&#x2019;s medical license was lifted, and he was back in the game.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, then,&#x201d; Cap said, &#x201c;do what you can. It&#x2019;s no crime to lower your expectations. Only not too far.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Does everything&nbsp;&#x2026; we do together&nbsp;&#x2026; have to be&nbsp;&#x2026; some sort of competition? Two-twenty&nbsp;&#x2026; two-twenty-one&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I assume we&#x2019;re going to have breakfast after our run and I don&#x2019;t believe in competitive eating, if that helps any.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course. It would be the one area I could kick your butt.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Chattahoochee Lodge had been built in the twenties for hunters and had been enlarged and renovated in 1957, the same year Elvis purchased Graceland. A sprawling, rustic complex, the main building was perched in the mountainous forest, high above the banks of the fast-flowing Chattahoochee River. As ecotourism boomed in the early 1990s, the place became a major destination for leisure travelers, birders, hikers, and convention goers, with rooms often booked a year in advance.</p> <p>Lou, board-certified in both internal and emergency medicine, had never particularly enjoyed medical conferences of any kind, so it was a godsend when he whined about the impending trip to Cap and learned that his friend&#x2019;s only living relative was an aging aunt, living just outside of Atlanta. Working full-time in the ER at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital, and part-time with the PWO, Lou had more than enough in his small war chest for another ticket south. The quite reasonable rent for his second-floor, two-bedroom apartment down the street from the gym and just above Dimitri&#x2019;s Pizza helped make a loan to his sponsor even more painless.</p> <p>Proof that the idea was a solid one was that Cap haggled surprisingly little over the bartering agreement Lou proposed&#x2014;two months of weekly sessions in the ring for him, plus an additional four lessons for his precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Emily. Cap would get the window seat.</p> <p>Having to put up with Filstrup notwithstanding, Lou loved his job at the PWO. The pay was lousy, but for him the irony of going from being a client to being an associate director was huge. The organization provided support and monitoring services for doctors with mental illness, physical illness, substance abuse, sexual boundary violations, and behavioral problems. Most new PWO contracts required the troubled physician to enter some sort of treatment program or inpatient rehab, followed by regular meetings with their assigned PWO associate director, along with frequent random urine screens for alcohol and other drugs of abuse.</p> <p>Lou was hardly averse to counseling and psychotherapy for certain docs, but he strongly believed that, physician or not, addiction was a medical illness and not a moral issue. Walter Filstrup disagreed.</p> <p>When Filstrup finally handed over his carefully typed speech and the conference program, the trip got even better. Not only would Lou and Cap have time for some training runs together in the mountains, but while Cap was visiting his aunt, Lou would be able to take a conference-sponsored guided tour of the Centers for Disease Control&#x2014;the CDC.</p> <p>More irony.</p> <p>Lou had spent nearly ten months of his life in Atlanta and had never even been close to the world-renowned institute. The last time he was in the city, nine years before, was for the one-year reunion of his treatment group at the Templeton Drug Rehab Center.</p> <p>It was time to complete some circles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Michael Palmer</p></p><h2>The Lost Family: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&nbsp;"<em>The Lost Family</em> is an extraordinary read, the kind of book that makes you sob and smile, the kind that gives you hope....

Yet hers is the steady love of a long acquaintance, an affection that has deepened from mere infatuation to a steady, clear-eyed regard. In this witty tribute to Florence, Mary McCarthy explores the city's past and present, in the process offering up a tour that covers everything from a description of oil painting to the remarkable history behind Florence's many towers. <i>The Stones of Florence</i> is ideal for reading on the plane ride to Italy, but it's also perfect for armchair travelers, art lovers, and students of the Renaissance.MARY MCCARTHY (1912-1989) was a short-story writer, bestselling novelist, essayist, and critic.

Three-fourths of the first group reported being homosexual or bisexual when interviewed in adolescence or young adulthood, while only a single member of the second group reported such orientation. Green recognizes the dangers implicit in a " `recipe' approach to preparing a developmental model of homosexual orientation" and offers instead a complex and multi-factored theory drawing on his clinical experience and statistical analysis. He is not concerned with "preventing" the development of homosexuality but in reducing the anxiety of those frequently stigmatized. Highly recommended for academic and large public libraries.

Highly trained vampire warriors who protect their species against the Lessening Society. As a result of selective breeding within the race, Brothers possess immense physical and mental strength as well as rapid healing capabilities. They are not siblings for the most part, and are inducted into the Brotherhood upon nomination by the Brothers. Aggressive, self-reliant, and secretive by nature, they exist apart from civilians, having little contact with members of the other classes except when they need to feed. They are the subjects of legend and the objects of reverence within the vampire world. They may be killed only by the most serious of wounds, e.g., a gunshot or stab to the heart, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>blood slave n.

Against the backdrop of ZeroSum&#x2019;s VIP area, she was something else, dressed in white patent leather strips, a cross between Barbie and Barbarella. It was hard to know if she was one of the club&#x2019;s professionals or not. The Reverend only trafficked in the best, but maybe she was a model for FHM or Maxim.</p><p>She planted her hands on the marble tabletop and leaned in toward him. Her breasts were perfect, the very best money could buy. And her smile was radiant, a promise of acts done with knee pads. Paid or not, this was a woman who got plenty of vitamin D and liked it.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, daddy?&#x201d; she said over the trippy techno music. &#x201c;Want to make my dream come true?&#x201d;</p><p>He shot her a hard smile.

Vishous and Rhage were out hunting lessers, those soulless bastards that killed their kind, but the two vampires were probably going to come in for a landing disappointed. The secret war between their species and the Lessening Society had been quiet all January and February, with few slayers out and around. This was good news for the race&#x2019;s civilian population.

Following in the footsteps of Virginia Woolf, Rona Jaffe, Maggie Shipstead,&nbsp;and Sheila Heti,&nbsp;Jana Casale writes with bold assurance about the female experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><br> We first meet Leda in a coffee&nbsp;shop on an average afternoon, notable only for the fact that it&#x2019;s the single occasion in her life when she will eat two scones&nbsp;in one day. And for the cute boy reading&nbsp;<i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i>.&nbsp; Leda hopes that, by engaging him, their banter will lead to romance. Their fleeting, awkward exchange stalls before flirtation&nbsp;blooms. But Leda&#x2019;s left with one imperative thought: she decides she wants to read Noam Chomsky. So she promptly buys a book and never&#x2014;ever&#x2014;reads it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the days, years, and decades of the rest of her life unfold, we see all of the things Leda does instead, from eating leftover spaghetti in her college apartment, to fumbling through the first days home with her newborn daughter, to attempting (and nearly failing) to garden in her old age. In a collage of these small moments, we see the work&#x2014;both visible and invisible&#x2014;of a woman trying to carve out a life of meaning. Over the course of her experiences Leda comes to the universal revelation that the best-laid-plans are not always the path to&nbsp;utter fulfillment and contentment, and in reality there might be no such thing. Lively and disarmingly honest,&nbsp;<i>The Girl Who Never Read Noam Chomsky</i>&nbsp;is a remarkable literary feat&#x2014;bracingly funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and truly feminist in its insistence that the story it tells is an&nbsp;essential&nbsp;one.</p><p><b>JANA CASALE</b> has a BFA in fiction from Emerson College and an MSt in creative writing from Oxford. Originally from Lexington, Massachusetts, she currently resides in San Francisco with her husband. <i>The Girl Who Never Read Noam Chomsky</i> is her first novel.<p><b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p><b>Deciding to Read Noam Chomsky </b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to read noam chomsky,&#x201d; Leda said. At this point in her life she had a stack of books she kept by the bed and a splinter in her right hand. She should have thought more closely about cleaning out her microwave. She had class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Each week she&#x2019;d sit in the window seat at the back of her school&#x2019;s library and study. On this day she had cried listening to &#x201c;All You Need Is Love&#x201d; as she took the subway to school. She didn&#x2019;t want people to know she was crying, so she took great care to blink away as many tears as she could, but she did so hope that <i>there was nothing you could do that couldn&#x2019;t be done</i>. She ate a partially crushed scone as she studied that afternoon. Later she&#x2019;d have another scone before bed. This was the only time in her life she consumed multiple scones in one day. As she ate she thought about the boy who lived in the apartment across the street and the word <i>Umbria</i>. The scone was blueberry, and after she finished it she folded up the wax paper and put it in her left coat pocket.<br><br>The only reasons she&#x2019;d remember for wanting to read Chomsky were all the varied intellectual ones that took precedence in her mind: an article she&#x2019;d read, a speech she&#x2019;d heard, a professor&#x2019;s suggestion. She didn&#x2019;t think of that day or that boy in the coffee shop, but the influence was no less significant, as faint and feckless as it was, a startling, disintegrating moment between herself and this stranger bursting and scattering like any and all moments of her life. She gave little more attention to it at the time than to the scone or to herself crying over a song she loved.<br><br>The coffee shop itself was near her apartment and one she frequented often. &#x201c;This caf� is so small, but its aesthetic is exceptional,&#x201d;was the way it had been described by a middle-aged woman in trendy clothes who once stood next to her in line. The woman bought a large coffee and some type of vegan muffin. Leda thought the muffin looked tasty and bought the same one and then took a bite and realized it was vegan. From then on when she thought of the caf� she thought of it as <i>so small with an exceptional aesthetic and terrible vegan muffins</i>. Not long after, they&#x2019;d started selling vegan donuts that were considerably better, but Leda would never find herself trying them. If she had, it&#x2019;s unlikely she would have amended her perception ofthe place. It was already burned into her by the ephemeral moment beside that woman in line.<br><br>That day, though, she ordered a hot chocolate and sat at a table in the corner. What she loved most about sitting at the coffee shop was not the coffee or the shop but the brief, listless feeling it gave her of having her life together. She could sit beside the richness and warmth and see herself as something so divinely competent. <i>This is what it is to be an independent person</i>, and she&#x2019;d take a sip. <i>This is what it is to be a cosmopolitan person</i>, and she&#x2019;d take a sip. So easily could she lose herself in the sense. It was haunting and complicated and undeniably silly. Outside she watched as a woman picked up dog poop in a plastic bag. <i>At least I know that I don&#x2019;t really have my life together. At least I know that I don&#x2019;t know</i>, she thought. She sat for a while longer before noticing the boy to her right. He was smartly dressed, with flood pants and thick-rimmed glasses. His hands were large, and he was reading <i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i>. She leaned forward in her seat and ran her fingers through her hair. Most days she held a very strong belief that her hair looked terrible except right after she&#x2019;d run her fingers through it. She fixed her shirt and adjusted her boobs, which had been lost in her bra to some degree. The boy looked like he was about twenty-four and possibly went to Boston University or was applying to a funded graduate program. She hoped he&#x2019;d come over and say something charming or witty, as she imagined a man with such nice glasses might. She cleared her throat to get his attention, but he didn&#x2019;t look up from his book. She got her phone out of her bag as noisily as possible and then sighed loudly, but nothing. After waiting a bit longer, she got up and walked past his table, headed for the napkins. She took three. He didn&#x2019;t notice her. She reached her hand down to the fourth napkin; for a second she had a sense that he might be watching her, but when she turned around she saw he hadn&#x2019;t looked up. She stood there for what was an inappropriate amount of time to get napkins, but she couldn&#x2019;t help it. <i>Why can&#x2019;t I just go talk to him?</i> she thought. He had such a dumb sweater on and his face was sour. She considered that maybe he wasn&#x2019;t even reading but pretending to read, seeking that same sense of solace she felt sitting with her hot chocolate. <i>Who is he in this coffee shop? No one, just like me. Can&#x2019;t we be no one together? </i>In an unprecedented strike of confidence, she decided to walk up to him. It was impulsive and decisive. If you&#x2019;d asked her then, she may have said her hair always looked nice and that she didn&#x2019;t need to run her fingers through it at all.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you reading?&#x201d; she asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That book.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you reading?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . . It&#x2019;s by Noam Chomsky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>The silence between them felt stale and all-consuming. She searched for the right segue into marriage and children, but there was nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;I just needed a napkin,&#x201d; she said, waving the napkins.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, nothing . . . Can I have this chair?&#x201d; she said, pointing to an empty chair that didn&#x2019;t belong to his table at all but to the empty table beside him.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . I guess so?&#x201d;<br><br>She dragged the chair noisily in the direction of where she had been sitting. When she sat back down her hot chocolate was cold.She pretended she got a phone call and left.<br><br>That was her last encounter with the future BU graduate.<br><br>A few weeks later she bought <i>Problems of Knowledge and Freedom&nbsp;</i>in a small bookstore specializing in rare and overpriced books. Walking through the aisles, she ran her fingers down the spines of books and smelled the softness of paper over her, under her. She didn&#x2019;t think of the boy or the napkins, but she did think of Noam Chomsky as the book cover grew sweaty in her palm. She relaxed her hand, wiped the sweat on her skirt, opened the book to page 53, closed it, and took a deep breath.<br><b>Chapter 2</b><br><br><b>The First Innate Truth</b><br>Nearing her early twenties, Leda had become obsessed with being linear. Latitude and longitude had formerly been ascribed to maps and a vague notion of Christopher Columbus she stored on the dwindling shelf of third-grade history in the back of her mind. To be linear was to be lines of thinness from her head to her feet. Lines and thinness. Thinness like her legs lifted over her head as she lay on the beach watching her legs, stinging sand in her eyes, blue everywhere. Lying down she could get away with it, but standing it was undeniable to her that she was not nearly linear enough. &#x201c;Latitude Is Attitude,&#x201d; she saw on a T-shirt once and never understood. Even as she was now so concerned with linearity and the latitude of herself, that T-shirt was still a confused lake in her mind. The girl who wore it had large breasts. And that was all she really remembered. <i>I do not want to live in the horizontal of my stomach. I do not want to be my thighs. I want to be linear. </i>This compulsion to be linear began at age twelve and would persist until her death. It was very important, VERY IMPORTANT not to be fat. This was the first innate truth of her womanhood.</p></p><h2>The Fragrance of Guava</h2><p>In these conversations Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982, speaks about his Colombian family background, his early travels and struggles as writer, his literary antecedents, and his personal artistic concerns. Marquez conveys, as he does in his work through the power of language, the heat and colour of the Spanish Caribbean, the mythological world of its inhabitants, and the exotic mentality of its leaders. Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, the journalist and novelist who shares these conversations, is a friend and contemporary of Marques, and also of Colombian extraction.</p><p></p><h2>Fargo</h2><p><b>Winner of the Academy Award as the best Original Screenplay of 1996.</b><br><br>Set in the midst of the bleak midwinter snow drifts of the American Midwest, <i>Fargo </i>is a story of murder and mayhem.<br><br>Stylistically, <i>Fargo</i>-in its observation of a specific Minnesota community-is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the post-modernism of <i>The Hudsucker Proxy </i>and the baroque hallucinations of <i>Barton Fink</i>. <i>Fargo </i>exposes the dark side of existence, but the grimness of the tale is alleviated by the laconic humor with which the characters greet their fates.

A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.<br> <br>Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.<br> <br><i>Beartown</i> explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain. In this story of a small forest town, Fredrik Backman has found the entire world.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2017:</strong> How do I love <em>Beartown</em>? Let me count the ways. It&#x2019;s a domestic drama in which a family is pulled apart by an act of violence. It&#x2019;s a coming-of-age story for a young woman who must choose to speak out or keep silent. (And a young man, too, actually.) It&#x2019;s a slow-build thriller, opening the story with the statement that one teenager is going to put a shotgun to the head of another and pull the trigger. It&#x2019;s a cautionary tale of small-town thinking...yet at the same time celebrates how a handful of people can change a tight-knit community. <em>Beartown</em> has so much going on within its enjoyably readable pages that putting it in a literary box is all but impossible&#x2014;and indeed that is one of the many reasons readers will pass this book amongst one another with a confident &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll like this.&#x201d; As the town&#x2019;s finances decline, small, scrappy Beartown hunkers deeper into itself, proud only of its white-hot junior hockey team led by a coach whose hard-driving mantra is, simply, &#x201c;Win.&#x201d; Seizing the upcoming hockey championship could lure a new hockey academy their way and jumpstart the local economy. But the exposure of a hidden crime sweeps the hockey club into its vortex and fractures the town and longtime friendships, even as it welds together new, unlikely alliances. Once the crime is revealed, <em>Beartown</em> could have strolled down an easy trail, but Backman refuses to tread it, sidestepping the predictable as he forges a new path of soul-searching and truth-telling. There are hard moments here, and readers might find difficult discoveries in their own hearts as the people of Beartown struggle with what they hope is real but fear is not. Masterful in its storytelling and honesty, this is another winner for Backman, surpassing even his much-lauded <em>A Man Called Ove</em>. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review </em>Fredrik Backman is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Man Called Ove </i>(soon to be a major motion picture starring Tom Hanks), <i>My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She&#x2019;s Sorry</i>, <i>Britt-Marie Was Here</i>, <i>Beartown</i>, <i>Us Against You</i>, as well as two novellas, <i>And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer</i> and <i>The Deal of a Lifetime.</i> His books are published in more than forty countries.

An elemental part of all religious pantheons before the Iron Age, goddesses have resurfaced in the modern era as embodiments of female strength and wisdom, encompassing a variety of media -- sculpture, painting, photography, performance art, and film. The artists who have portrayed her in all her guises range from prehistoric and tribal shamans to European painters and sculptors such as Bernini, Rubens, and Titian to modern artists including Louise Bourgeois, Audrey Flack, Frida Kahlo, Henry Moore, and Andy Warhol.Lanier Graham teaches at California State University, Humboldt, and has published extensively on world art, mythology, and spirituality.</p><h2>The Spider&#39;s Gift</h2><p>Although Katrusya&#39;s family cannot afford to celebrate Christmas, they cut a small pine tree in the forest, decorate it with buttons, and when baby spiders hatch in its branches, they especially enjoy the silvery webs that appear.</p><p>Katya Krenina collaborated with Eric A.

The opening line&#x2015;&#x201c;&#x2018;No Christmas?&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2015;will immediately grab kids&#x2019; attention; the rest of the story combines traditional, religious Christmas elements (such as the braided bread that represents the Holy Trinity) with an unexpected miraculous gift from spiders nesting in the family&#x2019;s Christmas tree. Cultural elements that may be unfamiliar, such as a bandura (similar to a mandolin), complement the recognizable sense of anticipation and preparation for this festive holiday. The impoverished family&#x2019;s <p></p> <p>homemade Christmas is a warm, happy one; their love is beautifully expressed in golden tones that highlight faces lit by candles in contrast with dark, shadowy backgrounds. The mystical element of the spider&#x2019;s gift, webs that turn into real silver in return for the family sheltering baby spiders in the tree, is true to the spirit of the original Christmas miracle.</p><i> <p>-Diane Foote</p></i> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br><p><strong>KIMMEL, </strong>Eric A., retel. <i>The Spider&#x2019;s Gift: A Ukrainian Christmas Story. </i>illus. by Katya Krenina. unpaged. notes.

After a family meeting, they decide to get a tree from the forest, make presents, and create a celebration without spending much money. Katrusya ventures out with her grandfather and picks a tree that seems special to her. They decorate it with buttons and handmade ornaments, but the peace is shattered when her mother discovers the tree is full of baby spiders. Katrusya pleads to keep it and the harmless spiders rather than throw them out into the freezing night. After the family returns from church on Christmas Eve, they find that the spiders&#x2019; webs have turned to silver, the buttons to gold, and jewels adorn the handmade ornaments. Katrusya declares they should share their bounty with the villagers and they do. The warm acrylic illustrations add to the folkloric feel of this charming, well-told tale.<i>&#x2013;Anne Connor, Los Angeles Public Library </i></p> (<i>School Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Totem and Taboo (Dover Thrift Editions)</h2><p>In this landmark collection of essays, published as <i>Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Psychic Lives of Savages and Neurotics</i> in 1918, the father of psychoanalysis explores the conflict between primitive feelings and the demands of civilization, i.e., the struggle to reconcile unconscious desires with socially acceptable behavior.<br>Totemism, a concept found in societies around the world, involves the belief in a sacred relationship between an object (totem) and a human kinship group. Men and women bearing the same totem are prohibited from marrying each other, this being a form of incest taboo. Freud identifies a strong unconscious inclination as the basis of taboo, and he attempts to define its source by tracing the earliest appearance in childhood development of totemism. After an examination of the incest taboo in primitive societies around the world, Freud discusses taboo and the ambivalence of emotions; animism, magic, and the omnipotence of thought; and the infantile recurrence of totemism.<br>An important work by one of the twentieth century's most influential thinkers, <i>Totem and Taboo</i> is essential reading for teachers and students of psychology as well as those with an interest in ethnology and folklore. This inexpensive edition offers all readers access to one of Freud's most penetrating attempts to decipher the mysteries of human behavior.</p><p>In this brilliant exploratory attempt to extend the analysis of the individual psyche to society and culture, Freud laid the lines for much of his late thought, and made a major contribution to the psychology of religion. Primitive societies and the individual, he found, mutually illuminate each other, and the psychology of primitive races bears marked resemblances to the psychology of neurotics. Basing his investigations on the finding of anthropologists, Freud came to the conclusion that totemism and its accompanying restriction of exogamy derive form the savage&#39;s dread of incest, and that taboo customs parallel closely the symptoms of compulsion neurosis. The killing of the &#39;primal father&#39; and the consequent sense of guilt are seen as determining events both in the misty tribal pre-history of mankind, and in the suppressed wishes of individual men. Both totemism and taboo are thus held to have their roots in the Oedipus complex, which lies at the basis of all neurosis, and, as Freud argues, is also the origin of religion, ethics, society, and art.Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology. His many works include The Ego and the Id; An Outline of Psycho-Analysis; Inhibitions; Symptoms and Anxiety; New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis; Civilization and Its Discontent, and others.</p><h2>Hope Meadows: Real Life Stories of Healing and Caring from an Inspiring Community</h2><p>Presents the remarkable true story of Hope Meadows, Illinois, a suburban town built on an abandoned Air Force base for the single purpose of providing a solution to the revolving-door foster care system, allowing &#34;unadoptable&#34; children a chance to thrive in permanent homes.</p><p><b>Wes Smith</b> has been a journalist for three decades, most recently as a national correspondant for the <b>Chicago Tribune</b>, where he worked for eleven years. He has written several books, and now contributes to magazines including <b>Business Week</b>, <b>Biography</b>, and <b>U.S. News</b>.This is the stirring story of the kind of village it takes to raise troubled, unwanted children. In 1994, the first families moved into Hope Meadows, a former military base in central Illinois. Academic activist Brenda Eheart (sociology, Univ. of Illinois, Urbana) developed this multigenerational alternative to the traditional foster care system. In return for adopting up to four special-needs children, parents receive free housing and a salary of $19,000 a year. Senior citizens obtain low rent in exchange for volunteer and mentorship work, and a therapist lives on-site. A collection of profiles of the various and sundry families, this book grew out of the veteran journalist-author's story for the Chicago Tribune in 1996. Chapters brim with testimonials and poignant case studies; selection criteria and placement failures are de-emphasized. A longer-term study of the outcomes of this project would have been useful, but media and political leaders already support this social experiment as a cost-effective approach to profound social problems. This month, Hope Meadows will be featured on The Rosie O'Donnell Show and, in May, in the debut issue of Rosie magazine, so stock up. Highly recommended for public libraries and child welfare collections.

And while Eli Goldratt is indeed a scientist, an educator and a business leader, he is first and foremost a philosopher; some say a genius.<br> He is a thinker who provokes others to do the same. Often characterized as unconventional, and always stimulating--a slayer of sacred cows-- Dr. Goldratt exhorts his readers to examine and reassess their lives and business practices by cultivating a different perspective and a clear new vision. In his latest book, The Choice, Goldratt once again presents his thought provoking approach, this time through a conversation with his daughter Efrat, as he explains to her his fundamental system of beliefs.</p><p>Foreword:<br> Eli Goldratt is probably best known by his millions of readers as a business guru. Those who know him a little better may think of him as a scientist and an educator, and to some he is a genius, a classification he vehemently denies. To me he is all that and, of course, much more. I have been Eli's publisher, editor and friend for over twenty-five years.<p> Early on I was aware that Eli is actually on a quest to demonstrate that the approach and methods of the hard sciences can and should be applied to the social sciences. He initially targeted management science, claiming that since in that branch of the social sciences results are measurable, people find it harder to dispute the superiority of using the hard science techniques. It was fascinating to see how gradually the business world accepted Eli's work in spite of the fact that so much of it is a drastic departure from tradition. His Theory of Constraints (TOC) is now taught at almost every business school and MBA program and has been used by thousands of companies and government agencies worldwide. TOC has been successfully applied in almost every area of human endeavor, from industry to health care to education. </p><p> Unlike his readers, I have had the opportunity to see Eli in action. Together we struggled in an industry-- the publishing industry--that views itself as so unique that its self-imposed limitations are almost written in stone. As of this writing we have published nine books together; books that have been translated into twentyseven languages, and sold many millions of copies. We have had tremendous success, outselling many bestsellers by far and keeping an undiminished market for our books. Eli's first book, The Goal, sells as many copies per year now as it did twenty years ago. Taking into account the millions of used copies available, this is a remarkable feat. Of course we made mistakes along the way, but each mistake led to new thought, new approaches, new ways, which in turn led to more success. </p><p> What I realized through that struggle is that Eli has developed much more than he was writing about. I became convinced that he developed a pragmatic life philosophy that guides not just his writing but also all his conduct. It's no wonder that I started to press him to share, in writing, his unique approach. For years, actually decades, he declined, claiming that he was not yet ready. At last I prevailed. This book is the result. I hope you enjoy and benefit from it as much as I do. </p><p> Laurence Gadd<br> The North River Press</p></p><h2>How to Stop Your Doctor Killing You</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>The Magic Garment: Principles of Costume Design</h2><p>Comprehensive, clear, well-illustrated, and concise!

These are among the few Icons that survived the wholesale destruction of Icons in the early eighth century. In contrast with the familiar and magnificent Icons of later history, these early Icons have a haunting simplicity and unfamiliar spiritual power. They come to us from a time closer to that of Christ, when faith was still alive with wonder, and possibilities were infinite. <p> In the course of her pilgrimage, Sister Wendy also reviews the history of Christian art, the meaning and function of Icons, and shares her thoughts on the relation between beauty, prayer, and the search for God.</p></p><p></p><h2>Marijuana Botany: An Advanced Study: the Propagation and Breeding of Distinctive Cannabis</h2><p><i>Marijuana Botany </i>presents the scientific knowledge and propagation techniques used to preserve and multiply vanishing Cannabis strains.

Naipaul&#x2019;s brilliant career, <b>A House for Mr. Biswas</b><i> </i>is an unforgettable story inspired by Naipaul's father that has been hailed as one of the twentieth century's finest novels.<br><br>In his forty-six short years, Mr. Mohun Biswas has been fighting against destiny to achieve some semblance of independence, only to face a lifetime of calamity. Shuttled from one residence to another after the drowning death of his father, for which he is inadvertently responsible, Mr. Biswas yearns for a place he can call home. But when he marries into the domineering Tulsi family on whom he indignantly becomes dependent, Mr. Biswas embarks on an arduous&#x2013;and endless&#x2013;struggle to weaken their hold over him and purchase a house of his own. A heartrending, dark comedy of manners, <b>A House for Mr. Biswas</b> masterfully evokes a man&#x2019;s quest for autonomy against an emblematic post-colonial canvas.</p><p>"Naipaul has constructed a marvelous prose epic that matches the best nineteenth-century novels for richness of comic insight and final, tragic power."&#x2013;<i>Newsweek</i>Introduction by Karl Miller</p><h2>Microcosm and Mediator: The Theological Anthropology of Maximus the Confessor</h2><p>One of the outstanding Christian thinkers of all time, Maximus the Confessor (ca. 580-662) exerted a powerful formative influence on the Church when it was still one and undivided. Maximus left his stamp on Christianity as it is now recognized by all three broad streams of Christian faith: Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. Yet for centuries the detailed study of Maximus&#39;s writings was neglected. The first edition of Thunberg&#39;s Microcosm and Mediator (1965) helped to transform this situation of indifference into one of intense interest in Maximus and the subtleties of his thinking. This new edition has been revised and expanded, with updated references and bibliographies. The focus of Microcosm and Mediator is Maximus&#39;s anthropology, his highly developed general reflections on human nature. Maximus understands man as, not only a being - a microcosm - who reflects the constitution of the created universe, but also as a being - a mediator - created in the image of God, whose task it is, in Christ, to reconcile the spiritual and the sensible into one homogeneous unity.</p><p>Lars Thunberg has been Assistant Professor of Dogmatics, Uppsala University and Lund University, Sweden, and Associate Professor of Missiology and Ecumenical Theology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.</p><h2>The Christmas Wedding</h2><p>The tree is decorated, the cookies are baked, and the packages are wrapped, but the biggest celebration this Christmas is Gaby Summerhill's wedding. Since her husband died three years ago, Gaby's four children have drifted apart, each consumed by the turbulence of their own lives. They haven't celebrated Christmas together since their father's death, but when Gaby announces that she's getting married--and that the groom will remain a secret until the wedding day--she may finally be able to bring them home for the holidays. <br><br>But the wedding isn't Gaby's only surprise--she has one more gift for her children, and it could change all their lives forever.

It restores the proper name of God, rather than using a traditional title in place of His name. His name is written as Yahweh and as its short form, Yah. The name of the Messiah is written as Yahshua, thus retaining the meaning of His name as Yah is Salvation. The text is made more readable by updating thousands of words into modern English.

Among the selections included here:<br><br>- The 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in support of same-sex marriage<br>- Justice Kennedy&#x2019;s majority opinion and Justice Scalia&#x2019;s dissent in the 2003 landmark Supreme Court decision striking down anti-sodomy laws<br>- President George W.

Sullivan provides little commentary, allowing the various authors gathered here to speak for themselves. No matter which side one supports on this issue, this anthology will enable both an intellectual support of one's own beliefs and a better, fuller understanding of the contrary position.Andrew Sullivan is a senior editor at <i>The New Republic</i>, where he was editor from 1991-1996; a columnist for <i>Time </i>magazine; and daily writer for www.andresullivan.com, one of the most influential political weblogs.&nbsp; He is the author of <i>Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality.</i>&nbsp; He holds a B.A. in modern history and modern languages from Oxford University and Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University.

He lives in New York City with his wife, Paola.Multimillionaire art collector Albert Barnes (1872-1951) wrote obscene letters to his enemies; he lashed art critics and dealers, and he insisted that he got rich through the discovery of a medicated silver solution that he, in fact, had merely promoted. The irascible chemist-turned-connoisseur championed the Harlem Renaissance, yet he was often patronizing in his treatment of blacks. He housed his art collection in a Philadelphia suburb to educate the masses, but his foundation's rigid admissions policy has severely limited the public's access to the galleries. Author of bios of Caruso and Puccini, Greenfeld offers an entertaining, balanced profile of the self-made nabob whose art collection includes works by Renoir, Matisse, Picasso, Cezanne, Demuth, Glackens, Titian and Rubens. He concludes with a plea to the Barnes Foundation to liberalize its restrictive policies.

The story is part mystery and part psychological drama, divided into three distinct sections. <p> In the year 2248, Mars is ruled by a Politburo-like committee that actively discourages dissent as well as travel and exploration of other planets.

Seventy years later, his great-grandson Edmond Doya becomes convinced that Icehenge is a hoax, and attempts to disprove Nederland's theory. </p><p> In addition to futuristic issues such as interstellar travel and the terraforming of Mars, Robinson's characters grapple with politics, careers, families, and aging. <i>Icehenge</i> is a worthy introduction to the author's winning combination of hard science and believable characterization. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p>On the North Pole of Pluto there stands an enigma: a huge circle of standing blocks of ice, built on the pattern of Earth's Stonehenge--but ten times the size, standing alone at the farthest reach of the Solar System.

"Fans of Food Network personality Paula Deen are well acquainted with her sons Jamie and Bobby through her program, as well as their own culinary travel show, 'Road Tasted.' This companion piece to the series recounts their visits to mom-and-pop establishments across the country, alongside the Deens' own take on featured establishments' signature dishes. Readers need not be familiar with the program to find the book useful, as the brothers offer a selection of dishes ranging from regional specialties such as Lobster Rolls and Brats to Truffles and Rosemary Lamb Chops. Some recipes, such as a basic cole slaw, require little preparation, and more involved recipes like Crab Corn Cakes with Basil-Jalapeno Sauce are still relatively easy to prepare. The book's focus on specific locales and their dishes elevates it a step above most of its type; instead of offering a basic recipe for grits, for example, the Deens offer a twist: two ounces of goat cheese. Traditional thumbprint cookies benefit from ground pecans incorporated into dough which is then rolled in chopped pecans; and corn bread is greatly enhanced by the chopped bacon and saut�ed apples folded into the batter. These memorable touches guarantee that this cookbook quickly becomes dog-eared from regular use." (<i>Publishers Weekly, for DEEN BROS. COOKBOOK</i>)<br><br>Beware, food lovers.

He's co-authored a number of books with various family members and this new offering doesn't stray far from his devotion to one of the most important things in his life &#x2013; family. Deen said the book . . . is a very accurate reflection of his views on family, food and the need for &#x201c;building relationships through food that will stand the test of time.&#x201d;The book is chock full of 125 recipes with a definite, honest Southern flavor, everything from roast Sunday chicken with seasonal vegetables to chicken and dumplings to Frogmore Stew and a clever take on jelly salad. The recipes are accompanied by four-color photographs, helpful tips on how to dress up a meal, preparation and cooking times and something near and dear to me &#x2013; inspired ideas for how to best use the leftovers.The chapter titles reflect Deen's whimsical side. With names like Hand Holdin', Are You Thirsty?, Wanna Snack and Can't Put Your Finger on it?, the chapters make for a delightful read. My personal favorite is the chapter titled Date With Old Sparky, the nickname that many folks in the South give to the electric chair. &#x201c;I asked myself the age-old question: If I was facing certain death, what would I want my last meal to be?&#x201d; he writes in the introduction to the chapter. The menu includes collard greens with cornmeal dumplings and black-eyed peas with ham hocks, but the dessert for his last meal is maybe my favorite recipe in the book, an offering he dubs an Ode to Dad's Dessert. &#x201c;I saw daddy eat this every night for 20 years,&#x201d; Deen writes.That's my kind of recipe; he had me at cane syrup.

She has a flawless Asscher cut diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons of Paris, and a fianc�e willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry her. But Rachel still mourns the fact that her birthfather, a man she never knew, won't be able to walk her down the aisle. Until: a shocking revelation draws Rachel in to a world of Shanghai splendor beyond anything she has ever imagined. Here we meet Carlton, a Ferrari-crashing bad boy known for Prince Harry-like antics; Colette, a celebrity girlfriend chased by fevered paparazzi; and the man Rachel has spent her entire life waiting to meet: her father. Meanwhile, Singapore's It Girl Astrid Leong is shocked to discover that there is a downside to having a newly-minted Tech Billionaire husband. A romp through Asia's most exclusive clubs, auction houses, and estates, <i>China Rich Girlfriend </i>brings us into the elite circles of Mainland China, introducing a captivating cast of characters, and offering an inside glimpse at what it's like to be gloriously, crazily, China-rich.</p><p>KEVIN KWAN was born and raised in Singapore. He currently lives in Manhattan. His first novel, <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, was a wild success. Visit Kevin Kwan at www.kevinkwanbooks.com.1<br><br>The Mandarin<br><br>Hong Kong, January 25, 2013<br><br>In early 2012, a brother and sister clearing out their late mother&#x2019;s attic in the London neighborhood of Hampstead discovered what appeared to be a cluster of old Chinese scrolls at the bottom of a steamer trunk. By chance, the sister had a friend who worked at Christie&#x2019;s, so she dropped them off--in four Sainsbury&#x2019;s grocery sacks--at the auctioneer&#x2019;s salesroom on Old Brompton Road, hoping they might &#x201c;take a look and tell us if they&#x2019;re worth anything.&#x201d;<br><br>When the senior specialist of Chinese Classical Paintings opened up one of the silk scrolls, he nearly went into cardiac arrest. Unfurled before him was an image so remarkably rendered, it immediately reminded him of a set of hanging scroll paintings long thought to be destroyed. Could this be The Palace of Eighteen Perfections? The artwork, created by the Qing dynasty artist Yuan Jiang in 1693, was believed to have been secretly removed from China during the Second Opium War in 1860, when many of the royal palaces were ransacked, and lost forever.<br><br>As staffers scurried around unrolling the scrolls, they discovered twenty-four pieces, each almost seven feet tall and in immaculate condition. Placed side by side, they spanned thirty-seven feet, almost filling the floor space of two workrooms. At last, the senior specialist could confirm that this was undoubtedly the mythical work described in all the classical Chinese texts he had spent much of his career studying.<br><br>The Palace of Eighteen Perfections was an opulent eighth-century imperial retreat in the mountains north of modern-day Xi&#x2019;an. It was said to be one of the most magnificent royal residences ever built, with grounds so vast that one had to travel between the halls on horseback. On these ancient silk scrolls, the intricate pavilions, courtyards, and gardens that meandered through a dreamlike blue-and-green mountain landscape were painted in colors so vibrantly preserved, they seemed almost electric in their iridescence.<br><br>The auction-house staff stood over the exquisite masterpiece in awed silence. A find of this caliber was like discovering a long-hidden painting by da Vinci or Vermeer. When the international director of Asian Art rushed in to see them, he began to feel faint and forced himself to take a few steps back for fear that he might fall onto the delicate artwork. Choking back his tears, the director finally said, &#x201c;Call Fran�ois in Hong Kong. Tell him to get Oliver T&#x2019;sien on the next flight to London.&#x201d;1<br><br>The director then declared, &#x201c;We need to give these beauties the grand tour. We&#x2019;re going to start out with an exhibition in Geneva, then London, then at our Rockefeller Center showroom in New York. Let&#x2019;s give the world&#x2019;s top collectors a chance to see it. Only then will we take it to Hong Kong, and sell it right before the Chinese New Year. By then the Chinese should be frothing at the mouth in anticipation.&#x201d;<br><br>Which is precisely how Corinna Ko-Tung came to be sitting in the Clipper Lounge of the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong a year later, impatiently awaiting the arrival of Lester and Valerie Liu. Her richly embossed business card listed her as an &#x201c;art consultant,&#x201d; but for a few select clients, she was a great deal more than that. Corinna was born to one of Hong Kong&#x2019;s most pedigreed families, and she secretly parlayed her extensive connections into a very profitable sideline. For clients like the Lius, Corinna did everything from refining the art on their walls to the clothes on their back--all in service of getting them memberships at the most elite clubs, their names onto the right invitation lists, and their children into the city&#x2019;s top schools. In short, she was a special consultant for social climbers.<br><br>Corinna spotted the Lius as they ascended the short flight of stairs up to the mezzanine lounge overlooking the lobby. The couple cut quite a striking picture, and she had to pat herself on the back for this. The first time Corinna met the Lius, they were both in head-to-toe Prada. To these new arrivals from Guangdong, it was the height of sophistication, but to Corinna, it just screamed clueless Mainland money. Thanks to her handiwork, Lester entered the Clipper Lounge looking particularly dapper in a bespoke three-piece suit from Kilgour of Savile Row, and Valerie was chicly clad in a silvery Persian lamb parka from J. Mendel, appropriately sized black pearls, and dove-gray suede Lanvin ankle boots. But there was something a little off about her outfit--the handbag was a mistake. The glossy ombre-dyed reptile-skin bag obviously came from some nearly extinct species, but it reminded Corinna of the sort of handbag only a mistress would carry. She made a mental note to drop a hint at the appropriate moment.<br><br>Valerie arrived at the table apologizing profusely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry we&#x2019;re late. Our chauffeur mistakenly took us to the Landmark Mandarin Oriental instead of this one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a problem,&#x201d; Corinna replied graciously. Tardiness was one of her pet peeves, but with the kind of retainer the Lius were paying her, she wasn&#x2019;t about to complain.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you wanted to meet here. Don&#x2019;t you think the tearoom at the Four Seasons is much nicer?&#x201d; Valerie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Or even the Peninsula,&#x201d; Lester chimed in, casting a dismissive eye at the rectangular 1970s-era chandeliers cascading from the ceiling of the lobby.<br><br>&#x201c;The Peninsula gets too many tourists, and the Four Seasons is where all the new people go. The Mandarin is where proper Hong Kong families have been coming to tea for generations. My grandmother Lady Ko-Tung used to bring me here at least once a month when I was a girl,&#x201d; Corinna patiently explained, adding, &#x201c;You must also leave out the &#x2018;Oriental&#x2019;--we locals simply call it &#x2018;the Mandarin.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Valerie replied, feeling a little chastised. She glanced around, taking in the subdued oak-paneled walls and armchairs with just the perfect amount of sag in the seat cushions, her eyes suddenly widening. Leaning closer in, she whispered excitedly to Corinna, &#x201c;Do you see who&#x2019;s over there? Isn&#x2019;t that Fiona Tung-Cheng with her mother-in-law, Alexandra Cheng, having tea with the Ladoories?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Lester asked, a little too loudly.<br><br>Valerie nervously shushed her husband in Mandarin. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stare--I&#x2019;ll tell you later!&#x201d;<br><br>Corinna smiled in approval. That Valerie was a quick study. The Lius were relatively new clients, but they were Corinna&#x2019;s favorite type of clients--Red Royals, she called them. Unlike fresh-off-the-boat Mainlander millionaires, these heirs of China&#x2019;s ruling class--known in China as fuerdai, or &#x201c;second-generation-rich&#x201d;--had good manners and good teeth, and had never known the deprivation of their parents&#x2019; generation. The tragedies of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were ancient history as far as they were concerned. Obscene gobs of money had come easily to them, so obscene gobs they were ready to part with.<br><br>Lester&#x2019;s family controlled one of China&#x2019;s largest insurance companies, and he met Valerie, the Shanghai-born daughter of an anesthesiologist, when they were both at the University of Sydney. With an ever-growing fortune and ever-refining taste, this thirtysomething couple was ambitiously striving to make their mark on the power scene in Asia. With homes in London, Shanghai, Sydney, and New York, and a newly constructed house that resembled a cruise liner in Hong Kong&#x2019;s Deep Water Bay, they were anxiously filling the walls with museum-quality art in the hopes that Hong Kong Tattle might soon do a feature.<br><br>Lester got right down to business. &#x201c;So how much do you think these scrolls will end up going for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s what I wanted to discuss with you. I know you said you were prepared to go up to fifty million, but I have a feeling we will break all records tonight. Would you be prepared to go up to seventy-five?&#x201d; Corinna said carefully, testing the waters.<br><br>Lester didn&#x2019;t flinch. He reached for one of the sausage puffs on the silver cake stand and said, &#x201c;Are you sure it&#x2019;s worth that much?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Liu, this is the single most important work of Chinese art to ever come on the market. It&#x2019;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to look so good in the rotunda!&#x201d; Valerie couldn&#x2019;t help blurting out. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to hang it so that the whole painting is panoramic, and I&#x2019;m having the walls on the first and second floors repainted to exactly match the colors. I love those turquoise tones . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Corinna ignored Valerie&#x2019;s chatter and continued. &#x201c;Aside from the artwork itself, the value of owning it will be incalculable. Think how much it will raise your profile--your family&#x2019;s profile--once it&#x2019;s known that you acquired it. You will have beat out the top collectors in the world. I&#x2019;m told that representatives for the Bins, the Wangs, and the Kuoks are bidding. And the Huangs just flew in from Taipei--interesting timing, isn&#x2019;t it? I also have it on good authority that Colin and Araminta Khoo sent a special team of curators from the National Palace Museum in Taipei to examine the piece last week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooh--Araminta Khoo. She&#x2019;s so beautiful and chic! I couldn&#x2019;t stop reading about that incredible wedding of hers. Do you know her?&#x201d; Valerie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I was at the wedding,&#x201d; Corinna said simply.<br><br>Valerie shook her head in wonder. She tried to imagine the middle-aged, mousy-looking Corinna, who always wore the same three Giorgio Armani pantsuits, at the most glamorous event ever to hit Asia. Some people had all the luck, being born into the right family.<br><br>Corinna continued her lecture. &#x201c;So let me give you the drill. The auction tonight begins at eight sharp, and I have secured us entry to the Christie&#x2019;s VVIP skybox. That is where you will be throughout the auction. I will be downstairs on the auction room floor, bidding exclusively for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be with you?&#x201d; Valerie was confused.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no. You&#x2019;ll be in this special lounge where you can look down onto all the action.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But won&#x2019;t it be more exciting to be down on the floor itself?&#x201d; Valerie pressed on.<br><br>Corinna shook her head. &#x201c;Trust me, you don&#x2019;t want to be seen on the auction floor. The VVIP skybox is where you want to be. That&#x2019;s where all the top collectors will be, and I know you will enjoy that--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Lester interrupted. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of buying the damn thing then? How will anyone know we made the winning bid?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First of all, you will be seen by everyone at the VVIP skybox, so people will already suspect, and first thing tomorrow, I will have one of my sources at the South China Morning Post issue an unconfirmed report that Mr. and Mrs. Lester Liu of the Harmony Insurance family acquired the painting. Trust me, that&#x2019;s the classy way to do it. You want people to speculate. You want to be that unconfirmed report.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooh, you&#x2019;re so brilliant, Corinna!&#x201d; Valerie squealed in excitement.<br><br>&#x201c;But if it&#x2019;s &#x2018;unconfirmed,&#x2019; how will people know?&#x201d; Lester was still confused.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiyah, slow tortoise, everyone will see the painting when we throw our housewarming party next month,&#x201d; Valerie chastised her husband, smacking him on the knee. &#x201c;They will confirm it with their own envious eyes!&#x201d;<br>The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, situated right on the harbor in Wan Chai, boasted overlapping curved roofs that resembled a gigantic manta ray gliding through the water. That same evening, a parade of starlets, boldface-name socialites, low-level billionaires, and the sort of people Corinna Ko-Tung deemed to be inconsequential paraded through the Grand Hall, vying for the most visible seats at the auction of the century, while the back of the room was packed to the rafters with the international press and onlookers. Upstairs in the plush VVIP skybox, Valerie and Lester were in seventh heaven as they rubbed elbows with the serious-money crowd over Laurent-Perrier champagne and canapes prepared by Cafe Gray.<br><br>When at last the auctioneer stepped up to the polished wood podium, the lights in the hall began to dim. A massive gold latticework screen ran along the wall facing the stage, and at the appointed moment, the screen began to part, revealing the hanging scrolls in all their glory. Brilliantly enhanced by the state-of-the-art lighting system, they almost appeared to glow from within. The crowd gasped, and when the lights came up again, the auctioneer promptly began the session without any fuss: &#x201c;An exceedingly rare set of twenty-four hanging scrolls from the Qing dynasty, ink and color on silk, depicting the Palace of Eighteen Perfections, by Yuan Jiang. Inscribed by the artist, and dated 1693. Shall we have an opening bid of--one million?&#x201d;<br><br>Valerie could feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins as she saw Corinna raise her blue-numbered paddle to volley the first bid. A flurry of paddles began popping up around the room, and the price began its stratospheric climb. Five million. Ten million. Twelve million. Fifteen million. Twenty million. Within a matter of minutes, the bid was at forty million. Lester leaned forward in his chair, analyzing the action on the auction-room floor like some complex chess match, and Valerie clawed her nails into his shoulder repeatedly in high anticipation.<br><br>When the bidding hit sixty million, Lester&#x2019;s phone rang. It was Corinna sounding frantic. &#x201c;Suey doh sei,2 it&#x2019;s going up too fast! We&#x2019;re going to pass your seventy-five-million limit in no time. Do you want to keep bidding?&#x201d;<br><br>Lester breathed in deeply. Any expenditure over fifty million would surely be noticed by his father&#x2019;s bean counters, and there would be some explaining to do. &#x201c;Keep going till I stop you,&#x201d; he ordered.<br><br>Valerie&#x2019;s head was spinning in excitement. They were so close. Imagine, soon she would own something that even Araminta Khoo coveted! At eighty million, the bidding finally slowed down. No more paddles in the room were raised with the exception of Corinna&#x2019;s, and it seemed like there were only two or three telephone buyers remaining to bid against the Lius. The price was going up only in increments of half a million, and Lester closed his eyes, praying he would get it for under ninety million. It was worth it. It was worth the scolding he would get from his father. He would make his plea that he had bought the family a billion dollars&#x2019; worth of good publicity.<br><br>Suddenly there came a commotion from the back of the auction room. Murmurs could be heard as the standing-room-only crowd began to give way. Even in a room packed with celebrities dressed to the nines, a hush came over the space as a strikingly attractive Chinese woman with jet-black hair, powdered white skin, and crimson lips, dramatically dressed in a black velvet off-the-shoulder gown, emerged from the crowd. Flanked by two snow-white Russian wolfhounds on long diamond leashes, the lady began to walk slowly up the central aisle as every head swiveled toward the sensational sight.<br><br>Clearing his throat discreetly into the mic, the auctioneer tried to regain the attention of the room. &#x201c;I have eighty-five point five million, who will say eighty-six?&#x201d;<br><br>1 Oliver T&#x2019;sien--one of Christie&#x2019;s most highly valued deputy chairmen--has long-standing relationships with many of the world&#x2019;s top collectors.

Lord Durham believed it was an expression of racial conflict.</p> <p><em>The Patriots and the People<em></em> is a fundamental reinterpretation of the Rebellion. Allan Greer argues that far being passive victims of events, the habitants were actively responding to democratic appeals because the language of popular sovereignty was in harmony with their experience and outlook. He finds that a certain form of popular republicanism, with roots deep in the French-Canadian past, drove the anti-government campaign. Institutions such as the militia and the parish played an important part in giving shape to the movement, and the customs of the maypole and charivari provided models for the collective actions against local representatives of the colonial regime.</em></p><em> <p>In looking closely into the actions, motives, and mentality of the rural plebeians who formed a majority of those involved in the insurrection, Allan Greer brings to light new causes for the revolutionary role of the normally peaceful French-Canadian peasant.

When the travel bug hit again, he decided to go big-time, taking on the world&#x2019;s most populous and intriguing nation. In <i>Lost on Planet China, </i>Troost escorts readers on a rollicking journey through the new beating heart of the modern world, from the megalopolises of Beijing and Shanghai to the Gobi Desert and the hinterlands of Tibet. <br><i><br>Lost on Planet China</i> finds Troost dodging deadly drivers in Shanghai; eating Yak in Tibet; deciphering restaurant menus (offering local favorites such as Cattle Penis with Garlic); visiting with Chairman Mao (still dead, very orange); and hiking (with 80,000 other people) up Tai Shan, China&#x2019;s most revered mountain. But in addition to his trademark gonzo adventures, the book also delivers a telling look at a vast and complex country on the brink of transformation that will soon shape the way we all work, live, and think. As Troost shows, while we may be familiar with Yao Ming or dim sum or the cheap, plastic products that line the shelves of every store, the real China remains a world&#x2014;indeed, a planet--unto itself. <br><br>Maarten Troost<i> </i>brings China to life as you&#x2019;ve never seen it before, and his insightful, rip-roaringly funny narrative proves that once again he is one of the most entertaining and insightful armchair travel companions around.</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2008</b>: Maarten Troost is a <i>laowai</i> (foreigner) in the Middle Kingdom, ill-equipped with a sliver of Mandarin, questing to discover the "essential <i>Chineseness</i>" of an ancient and often mystifying land. What he finds is a country with its feet suctioned in the clay of traditional culture and a head straining into the polluted stratosphere of unencumbered capitalism, where cyclopean portraits of Chairman Mao (largely perceived as mostly good, except for that nasty bit toward the end) spoon comfortably with Hong Kong's embrace of rat-race modernity. From Beijing and its blitzes of flying phlegm--and girls who lend new meaning to "Chinese take-out"--to the legendary valley of Shangri-La (as officially designated by the Party), Troost learns that his very survival may hinge on his underdeveloped haggling skills and a willingness to deploy <i>Rollerball</i>-grade elbows over a seat on a train. Featuring visits to Mao's George Hamiltonian corpse and a rural market offering Siberian Tiger paw, cobra hearts, and scorpion kebabs (in the food section), <i>Lost on Planet China</i> is a funny and engrossing trip across a nation that increasingly demands the world's attention. <i>--Jon Foro</i> <p></p> <b>Maarten Troost's Travel Tips for China</b> <p></p> <b>1. </b>Food can be classified as meat, poultry, grain, fish, fruit, vegetable and Chinese. Embrace the Chinese. If you love it, it will love you back. True, you may find yourself perplexed by what resides on your plate. You may even be appalled. The Chinese have an expression: <i>We eat everything with four legs except the table, and anything with two legs except the person</i>. They mean it too. And so you may find yourself in a restaurant in Guangzhou contemplating the spicy cow veins; or the yak dumplings in Lhasa, or the grilled frog in Shanghai, or the donkey hotpot in the Hexi Corridor, or the live squid on the island of Putuoshan. And you may not know, exactly, what it is you&#x2019;re supposed to do. Should you pluck at this with your chopsticks? The meal may seem so very strange. True, you may be comfortable eating a cow, or a pig, or a chicken, yet when confronted with a yak or a swan or a cat, you do not reflexively think of sauces and marinades. The Chinese do however. And so you should eat whatever skips across your table. It is here where you can experience the complexity of China. And you will be rewarded. Very often, it is exceptionally good. And when it is not, it is undoubtedly interesting. And really, when traveling what more can one ask for. So go on. Eat as the locals do. However, should you find yourself confronted with a heaping platter of Cattle Penis with Garlic, you&#x2019;re on your own. <p></p> <b>2. </b>To really see China, go to the market. Any market will do. This is where China lives and breathes. It is here where you will find the sights, sounds and smells of China. And it is in a Chinese market where you will experience epic bargaining. The Chinese excel at bargaining. They live and breathe it. It is an art; it is a sport. It is, above all, nothing personal. If you do not parry back and forth, you will be regarded as a chump, a walking ATM machine, a carcass to be picked over. And so as you peruse the cabbage or consider the silk, be prepared to bargain. The objective, of course, is to obtain the <i>Chinese price</i>. You will, however, never actually receive the Chinese price. It is the holy grail for <i>laowais</i>--or foreigners--in China. Your status as a laowai is determined by how proximate your haggling gets you to the mythical Chinese price. But you will never obtain the Chinese price. Accept this. But if you&#x2019;re very, very good, and you bargain long and hard, and if you are lucky and catch your interlocutor on an off day, you may, just may, receive the <i>special price</i>. Consider yourself fortunate. <p></p> <b>3. </b>Travelers are often told to get off the beaten path, to take the road less traveled, to march to a different drum. You don't need to do this in China. The road well-traveled is a very fine road. The French Concession in Shanghai is splendid. The Forbidden City is a wonder of the world. So too the Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an. Indeed, the Chinese say so themselves. There is much to be seen in places that are often seen. And yet... China is not merely a country. It is not a place defined by sights. It is a world upon itself, a different planet even. And to see it--to feel it--means leaving that well-traveled road. And China is an excellent place for wandering. From the monasteries of Tibet to the rainforests of Yunnan Province and onward through the deserts of Xinjiang to the frozen tundra of Heilongjiang Province, China offers a vast kaleidoscope of people and terrain unlike anywhere else on Earth. This may seem intimidating to the China traveler. Will there be picture menus in the Taklamakan Desert? (No.) Is Visa accepted in Inner Mongolia? (Not likely.) Still, one should move beyond the Great Wall. And if you can manage to cross six lanes of traffic in Beijing, you can manage the slow train to Kunming. <p></p> <b>4. </b>Hell is a line in China. You are so forewarned. <p></p> <b>5. </b>Manners are important in China. How can this be, you wonder? You have, for instance, experienced a line in China. Your ribs have been pummeled. You have been trampled upon by grandmothers who are not more than four feet tall. You have learned, simply by queuing in the airport taxi line, what it is like to <i>eat bitter</i>, an evocative Chinese expression that conveys suffering. This does not seem upon first impression to be a country overly concerned with prim etiquette. But it is. True, hawking enormous, gelatinous loogies is perfectly acceptable in China. And a good belch is fine as well. And picking your teeth after dinner is a sign of urbane sophistication. But this does not mean that manners are not taken seriously in China. It&#x2019;s just that they are different in China. And so feel free to spit and burp, but do not even think of holding your chopsticks with your left hand. You will be regarded as an ill-mannered rube. So watch your manners in China. But learn them first. <br><br><p><b>J.

On his release from captivity and in search of something to restore his spiritual connection to life, he had a transformative encounter with one of the two revered founders of Santo Daime, Padrinho Sebastiao Mota de Mela. Santo Daime--an Amazonian religion, born out of jungle entheogens, mediumship, and healing, that is a potent and unique synthesis of Christianity and indigenous practices--provided Alverga with an alternative to his disillusionment with modern society.

The Santo Daime is a Christian-indigenous syncretic religion that centers around the drinking of a sacramental psychedelic tea called Ayahuasca as a shortcut to spiritual revelation and growth. After years of study, the Brazilian government decided that Ayahuasca positively benefited society and church members, and declared it legal. Approximately 50 Santo Daime churches now exist around the world, including in the U.S., Japan, and Holland, with various legal statures.

As a theoretical physicist, Murray Gell-Mann has explored nature at its most fundamental level. His achievements include the 1969 Nobel Prize for work leading up to his discovery of the quark&#x2014;the basic building block of all atomic nuclei throughout the universe. But Gell-Mann is a man of many intellectual passions, with lifelong interests in fields that seek to understand existence at its most complex: natural history, biological evolution, the history of language, and the study of creative thinking.<br><br>These seemingly disparate pursuits come together in Gell-Mann's current work at The Santa Fe Institute, where scientists are investigating the similarities and differences among <i>complex adaptive systems&#x2014;</i>systems that learn or evolve by utilizing acquired information. They include a child learning his or her native language, a strain of bacteria becoming resistant to an antibiotic, the scientific community testing new theories, an artist implementing a creative idea, a society developing new customs or superstitions, a computer learning to play chess, or the human race evolving ways of living in greater harmony with itself and with other inhabitants of the Earth.<br><br><i>The Quark and the Jaguar</i> is an engaging, elegantly written introduction to the life's work of one of this century's most accomplished and influential scientists. This is Gell-Mann's own story of finding the connections between the basic laws of physics and the complexity and diversity of the natural world. The simple: a quark inside an atom. The complex: a jaguar prowling its jungle territory in the night. Exploring the relationships between them becomes a series of exciting intellectual adventures.<br><br></p><p>The Nobel Prize-winner's story of finding the connections between the basic laws of physics and the diversity of the natural world links such disparate subjects as chimpanzee behavior, avalanche mechanics, superstring theory, and Gilbert and Sullivan.<p> "A stimulating, provocative, and uncommon cut across compartments of human knowledge that are usually hermetically sealed.

After he died in 1992, access was granted to award-winning photographer Perry Ogden to work undisturbed for days on end to produce this riveting record of the house and its contents. In the studio itself, thirty years of inspired artistic endeavor had accumulated unchecked: the slashed and discarded canvases scattered across the floor; the brushes, rags, and tins encrusted with paint; the doors and walls used as impromptu palettes; the piles of photographs of friends and models; the crumpled and torn pages of magazines and books that served as a stimulus for Bacon&#39;s work; the notes, sketches, and ideas for paintings jotted down and then cast aside; the last unfinished self-portrait on the easel. For some of those close to Bacon, the studio was a heroic statement, a work of art in its own right, secretly constructed over many years to distill and give form to his aesthetic intentions. Now in this astonishing book we are invited to take a privileged look around this private space, to become intimate witnesses to the amazing conditions in which Bacon lived and worked, to gain unrivaled insights into how, why, and what he painted. 60 color photographs.</p><p>Edwards was Francis Bacon&#39;s closest companion for the last 20 years of the artist&#39;s life, and is his sole heir.Documenting the painter's London live/ work space as he left it, 7 Reece Mews: Francis Bacon's Studio lovingly takes stock of the late Irish artist's stacked canvases, crushed paint tubes, shelves of books, bust of Blake, on-the-wall color tests and stacks of assorted ephemera as he left them in 1992. Irish photographer Perry Ogden took the 60 carefully framed color photos here, and Bacon's companion John Edwards contributes an introductory essay.

He discusses such topics as the efficacy of prayer, the various uses of the phrase &#x201c;I believe,&#x201d; the religious implications of life on other planets, the meaning of words like &#x201c;culture&#x201d; and &#x201c;religion,&#x201d; and the idea of the Second Coming.<br></p><p>" We are not the playwright, we are not the producer, we are not even the audience. We are on the stage. To play well the scenes in which we are "on" concerns us much more than to guess about the scenes that follow it. " <br>In these seven witty, lucid, and tough-minded essays, the famous, infamous Screwtape makes a special appearance, proposing a toast that brilliantly explores the many opportunities for exploiting evil in the world. Lewis also considers the evidence for whether and how prayer works, plays with the meaning of the words I believe, and asks what happens to our concept of God when we send rockets into outer space. And, in a moving final piece, he forces us to wonder how we should live if any day might bring the world s last night. Anyone who ever appreciated his unique blend of humor, paradox, and searing insight will find these further thoughts from C.S. Lewis richly illuminating and remember that he is, as ever, one of the greatest writers and challengers of living faith. <br>"[Lewis] addresses himself to the task of disputing belief with energy, humor, and intense conviction."

From Robert Capa's stark photograph of a Loyalist soldier being shot in the head during the Spanish Civil War to Eve Arnold's astonishingly intimate portraits of well-known faces - from Joan Crawford to Malcolm X - Magnum has changed how we perceive our political leaders, social crises, and the communities next door.<br>Magnum's photographers are some of the most talented, brave, and resourceful in the world: the founders, Robert Capa, David Seymour, George Rodger, and Henri Cartier-Bresson; and recruits, including Eve Arnold, Bruce Davidson, Mary Ellen Mark, Susan Meiselas, Inge Morath, James Nachtwey, Eugene Richards, and Sebastiao Salgado. Magnum follows them on assignment, facing bodyguards and visa troubles and taking to the risk-filled trenches of several wars for the perfect shot. Full of wonderful stories and heroic feats, Magnum is an essential volume for anyone interested in photography or photojournalism.</p><p>"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough," said Robert Capa, the legendary photojournalist who, with Henri Cartier-Bresson and other documentary shooters, founded the Magnum press agency in 1947. Capa got close to the action, of course; he died under fire in Indo-China in 1954, seeking the perfect image of war. Other Magnum photographers died in places like Afghanistan, Israel, and Chechnya, always at the forefront of battle and strife, always with an eye on capturing history as it unfolded. In this well-written study of their work, British journalist Russell Miller shows how their images have changed the ways in which we respond to war, politics, and crises.<i> --Gregory McNamee</i>A profile of one of the most influential and prestigious photo agencies in the world, told through the lives of its founding members. On the occasion of Magnums 50th anniversary, Miller, a British journalist and author of ten books, has written a lively, sympathetic history of the organization and the characters who defined it. Magnum has always been synonymous with outrageous talent. Founded by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, David Seymour, and George Rodger in 1947, the agency was intended to release its members from the dictates of magazine editors and allow them greater artistic freedom and copyright control. Its cooperative mandate, for which Capaa charming hedonist and talented war photographerwas responsible, immediately set it apart from other purely commercial ventures. So did the visions of its founding members. With their lightweight Leica and Contax cameras, Capa and his brethren were able to travel to the most distant lands and dangerous conflicts and bring back images that mesmerized the world. Miller skillfully juxtaposes their compelling storiesof military offensives, celebrity-gilded parties, and perfect shotswith equally detailed information about the more quotidian challenges they faced, from rivalry to financial ruin. Miller devotes an entire chapter to the story of Eugene Smith, a brilliant photographer who joined Magnum in 1955 and subsequently wreaked havoc. Although he was known to be difficult, few of his peers anticipated that he would not only endanger the agency financially (he borrowed thousands from it to support his drug and alcohol addictions) but also divide its ranks. By the time he resigned, his fellow photographers were relieved, yet still compassionatetypical, Miller believes, of Magnums solidarity. Even those members who have decided to resign, Miller writes, almost invariably leave with some smatterings of regret. Miller debunks lingering myths about the agency and provides an entertaining account of the mesh and fray of personalities associated with it.

Wade--that appeared before the Supreme Court while it was led by liberal Chief Justice Earl Warren and the effect those landmark decisions have had on both legal precedent and the American society.</p><p>Morton Horwitz's <i>The Warren Court and the Pursuit of Justice</i> is a book for the layperson outlining the changes the Warren Court created in America's civil liberties jurisprudence. While the book is in no sense a polemic, Horwitz assumes the reader shares his view that what the Warren Court wrought was progress, and he criticizes the justices only when they failed to reach liberal results. Justice Byron White would have winced at the way Horwitz characterizes decisions and justices as being simply "liberal" or "conservative," and one could argue that such a politicization is a problem rather than a virtue. But ACLU members and casual students of American legal history will find the book a quick read that touches upon all of the substantial decisions in a critical period of the Supreme Court's life. <i>--Ted Frank</i>Morton J.

In the 11th volume of the Redwall series, Brian Jacques offers an enchanting tale with brave new heroes and deliciously evil villains, weaving a literary spell for readers of all ages.</p><p>For this enchanting novel Brian Jacques has brought to bear the experience of his eventful and adventuresome life, a life which has taken him all over the world and seen him variously described as folk singer, playwright, and broadcaster. No doubt his usual writing environment--garden in summer, conservatory in winter--provides him with the ideal theater for observing the wildlife on which the book's unusual central characters are based. <p> It is, perhaps, appropriate that the story line revolves around the theft of the famous Redwall Tapestry, for <i>Marlfox</i> is a richly woven tapestry, skillfully running together threads of the magical and mythical with the "natural world," to give its audience a heady blend of fairy tale and medieval adventure. The result is a tale of grand themes and conflicting human passions played out against a backdrop of humor and uncertainty; yet the author manages never to lose sight of the reality of life as experienced by the human and animal kingdoms alike. </p><p> Young readers will gorge themselves on this literary feast, a spread worthy of comparison to other classics in this vein such as <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>Duncton Wood</i>, <i>The Mythical Knights of the Round Table</i>, and the stories of C.S. Lewis.</p>Brian Jacques was born and bred in Liverpool. At the age of fifteen he went to sea and travelled the world.

Annie Proulx, Edward Abbey, Thomas McGuane, David Quammen, and Jane Smiley--have made the magazine a venue for some of their most compelling work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Best of Outside</b> represents the finest the award-winning magazine has to offer: thirty stories that range from high action to high comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it's Jonathan Raban sailing the open sea, Susan Orlean celebrating Spain's first female bullfighter, or Jim Harrison taking the wheel on a cross-country road trip, each piece can be characterized in a word: unforgettable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commemorating Outside magazine's twentieth anniversary, <b>The Best of Outside</b> is one of the most entertaining and provocative anthologies of the decade.</p><p>For two decades <i>Outside</i> magazine has remained committed to good writing, publishing feature articles from well-known authors on a variety of topics connected (in sometimes obscure yet fascinating ways) to the outdoors, adventure, travel, and just about anything else that happens beyond the confines of the mall.

Aimee Semple McPherson was consecrated to God, before she was born, by her mother, a soldier of the Salvation Army. She was a scamp in school, a young widow in China, and a neurotic housewife in Rhode Island. But when the Lord spoke to her as she was at death&#39;s door, she accepted her ministry. She preached up and down the United States, traveling in a 1912 Packard with her mother and her children, without a man to fix tires. She preached in tents, concert halls, boxing rings, and speakeasies, prayed for the healing of hundreds of thousands of people, founded a Church, built a Pentecostal temple of Hollywood dimensions in Los Angeles (Charlie Chaplin advised her on sets, Anthony Quinn played saxophone in the pit), and she became, in the 1920s and 1930s, such a celebrity that the press publicly thanked her for having given work to so many journalists. Sister Aimee is the story of a unique woman; of the power of passion that rejects compromise and a faith that will not be shaken. But it is also the story of the price of fame. Exhaustion, insomnia, nervous breakdowns, sexual scandals, lawsuits, and ultimately loneliness.Daniel Mark Epstein is a poet and playwright.

It's set in a deadly Asian underworld where terrorism, international influence peddling, and illegal immigration converge into a single sinister web with a heartless Chinese crime lord at its center.<p>To prankster/L.A. playboy Wheeler Cassidy, things look a little bleak. His trust land is dwindling, his good looks are dissolving into the daiquiris, and his life has no direction -- until his golden-boy younger brother, a prominent lawyer and political power broker; is found mysteriously dead. Wheeler joins forces with the beautiful Tanisha Williams, an L.A. cop from South Central who's been parked on the Asian Crimes Task Force while Internal Affairs investigates her career. Together they embark on a dangerous quest for the truth -- against deadly odds.</p><p>Tentatively at first, then with growing confidence and passion, the two follow their leads into a labyrinth of violent intrigue and a multibillion-dollar Chinese criminal conspiracy that teaches to the top of the U.S. government. Soon they find themselves up against the most ruthless Triad leader, the Washington Establishment, and violent L.A. gangsters. As <em>Riding the Snake</em> races to a riveting climax in the sewers beneath Los Angeles International Airport, you can almost hear it ominously ticking down -- like the suitcase nuke that's set to incinerate a big chunk of Southern California.</p><p></p></p><p>Stephen Cannell's extensive experience as a television writer (he's most famous for creating and scripting <i>The Rockford Files</i>) is readily apparent in <i>Riding the Snake</i>. He's done his homework, so his movement among the worlds of the aging playboy Wheeler Cassidy, the Hong Kong Triad, and the Asian Crimes Task Force of the LAPD is natural and well executed. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Cannell's book, though, is his depiction of Tanisha Williams, a young and gifted African American detective on the LAPD. Tanisha is assigned to Asian Crimes to get her out of the way--she's refused the advances of her superior, and now she's been put under investigation. She eventually crosses paths with Cassidy who is jolted from his wastrel life of alcoholic binges and womanizing by the mysterious disappearance of his brother and the gruesome murder of his brother's secretary. Cassidy and Williams join together to investigate what appears to be a massive infiltration of the U.S. government by powerful leaders of Chinese organized crime; along the way they develop an unlikely romance. The novel blurs reality with fiction, talking about President Clinton's attempts to normalize relations with China and making connections between real campaign scandals and Cannell's fictional Chinese mobsters. While the metaphors are occasionally strained, Cannell is an old-style craftsman who knows how to tell a good story and keep his reader fully engaged until the final pages. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i>idy, charming prankster and scion of a wealthy Beverly Hills family, has never done much with his life except play golf, drink, and seduce other men's wives.&nbsp;&nbsp;But after his politically connected brother's mysterious death, Wheeler embarks on a perilous journey to find himself and the Chinese gangsters who murdered the only member of his family he ever really loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, he teams up with Tanisha Williams, a beautiful African-American detective raised in South Central and now assigned to the L.A.P.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian Crime Task Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;Born just fifteen minutes from each other but worlds apart, the two make a combustible pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Together, they face the violence and corruption that stretches from Hong Kong's most notorious criminal Triad to the highest reaches of American government.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an international conspiracy of huge proportions which will take Wheeler and Tanisha halfway around the world and into the most dangerous adventu</p><h2>Sandusky Tool Co. 1877 Catalog</h2><p>One of the most important of the 19th century wooden plane manufacturers.

Or that it is only our world, dressed up for a storyteller's pleasure?Set aside your doubts ... this world was as real as any you will know ... and learn about the timedivers' dawn.

THE SLIGHT, sandy-haired woman looked as though she carried perhaps a score of years, until she gazed upon one, and the darkness behind her eyes delivered the weight of centuries."Yes, Mother." The second woman, also slender and sandy-haired, could have been a twin to the first, except for the lesser depth of her eyes."It's time.""I know.""There can be no more witches in Eastron. Not now. Not with the empress of Westron's demands, and the weaknesses in the Duchy.""But the Bardwalls still stand ... .""And they will, and you may always return to look upon them. You must make a place among the people of Westron and learn their technologies. Our time has gone and will not come again for centuries. Not until they have stripped the last metals from the ground. Not until they have been hurled from the skies.""Mother?""Yes.""Do you really believe that?""Daughter, I know that Eastron is dying, and all the villagers and all the gentry will blame it on the witches. Because of the duke our faces are too well known. So I will face the empress with him, come what may, and you will survive.""Mother!"There is no answer, for the older witch has vanished.The younger woman looked around the retreat, then continued placing her few things in the pack, which will be all that she can carry on her instant yet long journey.&nbsp;<br>IT SEEMS SO simple.

Whmmmpt!</i>"Suffer not a witch, nor a witch's child ..."The boy looked from one face to another, back and forth, as if seeking reassurance.<i>Crack!</i>One of the rocks struck his shoulder, hard enough to stagger him."Witch! Witch! Witch!" The chant began in earnest, echoing between the walls, drowning out the occasional low rumble of dry cloud thunder. Thunder that promised nothing but clouds that delivered no rain, no respite."Witch! Witch! Witch ... !"<i>Crack!</i>Suddenly, the boy's dazed expression vanished and his face screwed up, as if he were about to cry. In a single motion, he tightened his lips and jumped down on the far side of the wall, away from the crowd, and began to run.<i>Pad, pad, pad, pad ... !</i> The alleyway remained silent for an instant, the villagers momentarily silenced."Witch! Witch! Witch ... !" The chant took on an even more frantic note.Some of the veterans dragged themselves over the wall and hobbled or ran, knives in the hands of those who still had hands, after the fleeing child. Others turned back into the main street and dashed around toward the other end of the alley into which the child had fled."Witch! Witch! Witch ... !"<i>Thud! Thud, thuuddd, thhuuddd . .</i> . The heavy roll of the priests' drums supplemented the chant.From huts and houses, from the vintners and the villas, the pursuers gathered, pounding down street and alley, tearing through house and hovel."There he is!"" ... witch-child ... !""SUFFER NOT A WITCH TO LIVE, NOR A WITCH'S CHILD!" boomed the amplified voice of the priest.The boy, backed into a narrow niche between two walls behind the produce market, held a rock in each hand, waiting.<i>Crack!</i> The first rock from a villager slapped against the wall.<i>Crack! Thud! Crack! Thud!</i> The past experience of the rock throwers showed as stone after stone bounced against and around the boy.He threw one stone back. It missed. He threw the other."Devil! Witch-child!"Overhead, the dry thunder rumbled, and the dry clouds churned.A rivulet of blood dribbled down the boy's face, no longer expressionless, but filled with rage, even as the tears diluted his blood into pinkish streaks.<i>Crack! Thud! Thud!</i>"Gone!"" ... damned witches ... ! reclaimed their own ..."The small niche in the walls was empty, vacant but for rocks and streaks of blood upon the walls." ... YOU HAVE RECLAIMED YOUR BIRTHRIGHT FROM THE WITCHES THIS DAY ..." bellowed the amplifier.A third of a world away, two soldiers paused by the roadside to investigate a heap of clothing."Kid ... been beaten ...""Forcer!""Frillen, now what? Another discarded sack that has to be an aggre-bel?" The heavy-set and silver-haired forcer glared at the two as he spoke.The trooper pointed. "Kid. Beaten. He's still breathing.""He'll live. Put him in the rear freighter with Garchuk. He looks strong. The ConFed home will take him. Now, let's get moving."The two troopers shrugged. One lifted the boy and marched toward the military freight steamer. The other followed the ConFed forcer.<i>Timediver's Dawn</i>, copyright � 1992 by L. E.

He has written a numbAnthony Summers formerly covered wars and other world new events for the BBC. He has written a number of previous books, including HONEYTRAP, THE KENNEDY CONSPIRACY, an acclaimed study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and - with co-author Robbyn Swan - THE ARROGANCE OF POWER, on Richard Nixon, SINATRA: THE LIFE and THE ELEVENTH DAY: THE DEFINITIVE ACCOUNT OF 9/11. THE ELEVENTH DAY was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and won the Golden Dagger for crime non-fiction. The Dagger was also awarded for THE KENNEDY CONSPIRACY, and films have been based on both GODDESS and HONEYTRAP. Summers is married, has six children and lives in Ireland.Summers claims to have interviewed more than 600 people in the course of writing this book, and the effort shows in this exhaustiveand exhausting biography. Overall, the book is well written. Of the new material presented, the most provocative is Summers's assertion that Monroe's corpse was first discovered by Robert Kennedy and Peter Lawford. The reason for the confusion of facts about her death, says Summers, is that a coverup was conducted to hide Monroe's sexual involvement with both John and Robert Kennedy. Since Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller declined to be interviewed, this is not the definitive Monroe biography. Still, libraries that do not already have a surfeit of books on Monroe should find this a popular addition. Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club featured alternates. John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

Pinpointing individuals associated with Alec Station, the CIA&#x2019;s Osama bin Laden unit, as primarily responsible for many of the intelligence failures, this account analyzes the circumstances in which critical intelligence information was kept from FBI investigators in the wider context of the CIA&#x2019;s operations against al-Qaeda, concluding that the information was intentionally omitted in order to allow an al-Qaeda attack to go forward against the United States. The book also looks at the findings of the four main 9/11 investigations, claiming they omitted key facts and were blind to the purposefulness of the wrongdoing they investigated.

Comprising over a thousand pages and weighing 10kg (22lbs), it is one of the larges tattoo book sever published! It's three large-format volumes are contained inside a lavish and sturdy hardcover box. BLACK &amp; GREY TATTOO explores a monochrome art form through a kaleidoscope of the most widely diverse interpretations and craftsmanly techniques, performed by tattoo artists from all parts of the world.<br><br>This tattoo tome explores the origins of black &amp; grey tattooing -- from the prisons and streets of LA to its contemporary resonance on Hollywood's red carpets, at heavy metal music fests, and in private ateliers from Budapest to Beijing. While rendered in just shades of grade, the spectrum of design is vast: Aztec warriors, fierce harpies, family portraits, religious icons and permanent shrines to celebrities adorn these pages. The common thread among them all is their inventive exposition and mastery of execution.<br><br>BLACK &amp; GREY TATTOO is divided into three parts: Traditional Black &amp; Grey, Dark/Horror, and Photorealism. Indeed, there's cross-pollination among the different styles, but the breakdown isn't just for easier lifting of this monster collection. It is to show how tattoos with similar stylistic elements are interpreted differently by stellar artists around the world. The book also presents the fine art -- including paintings and charcoals -- of many of those featured, although the tattoos themselves should be considered fine art.<br><br>The first volume, Traditional Black &amp; Grey (336 pages) is somewhat of a misnomer as it's simply called "black &amp; grey" in the tattoo community. But now that greyscale tattooing has moved in different artistic directions, the "traditional" label is used to set it apart from its offshoots. Traditional black &amp; grey denotes tattoo art that has stayed true to its roots -- a time when homemade machines made of cassette motors and guitar strings dipped in India ink and wash were used to mark skin. The essence of black &amp; grey art is captured in the photography of co-author Edgar Hoill. Select imagery, with quotes from the artists and collectors, leads this volume followed by interviews with Jack Rudy, the Godfather of Black &amp; Grey; as well as tattoo prodigy Jesus "Chuey" Quintanar. Their stories and tattoo work precede the gallery, which includes tattoos from other pioneers of the style: Freddy Negrete, Brian Everett, and Mark Mahoney.<br><br>The Dar/Horror volume (400 pages) delves into personal demons relayed on tskin. Paul Booth, often described as the "dark Lord of Tattooing," reveals some of the reasons why people get these tattoos as well as how his own demons have driven his art. Other tattoos pay homage to horror in pop culture. Artist Xu Zhicheng of Tianzhilong Tattoo in Beijing says in his interview that he finds inspiration for his large scale dark work in vampire films, not personal angst. In this chapter, yo'll find eveything from shrunken heads to Frankensteins to even famous tattoo artists rendered as zombies.<br><br>The Photorealism volume (272 pages) encapsulates work that takes photorealistic art and translates it on the body. while the other chapters also feature realism, this chapter concentrates on portraiture, scenery, and even fantastical images rendered in true-to-life tableaux. Two artists renowned in this style, Bob Tyrrell and Andy Engel, talk about how they honed their craft and even offer tips on how others can do so as well. Their interviews are followed by work that has invigorated the tattoo community with the possibilities of mastering a difficult art on a difficult canvas. <br><br>All three volumes in this one collection are meant to inspire, showing just how beautiful black &amp; grey tattoo art can be. <br><br>Texts in English, German and Spanish with more than 860 full-color photographs</p><p></p><h2>A Treatise on Earthly-Mindedness</h2><p>In this important work, Burroughs shows from Scripture the great sin of thinking as the world thinks rather than thinking God&#39;s thoughts after Him. Then, realizing that right conduct is the result of right thinking, Burroughs gives us another gem in the second treatise offered here, A Heavenly Conversation, or Walk with God.The Puritans rightly discerned the relationship between a person&#39;s doctrine and their walk before God and fellow man. May the Lord use these sermons to give us the same kind of discernment in our day. May we learn to think biblically, and then may we begin to act accordingly. Author Jeremiah Burroughs was a prolific writer, highly esteemed by Puritan leaders of his day, some of whom published his writings after his death.

But his new life is shattered when he and Conawago discover a dying Virginian officer nailed to an Indian shrine tree. To their horror, the authorities arrest Conawago and schedule his hanging. As Duncan begins a desperate search for the truth, he finds himself in a maelstrom of deception and violence. The year is 1760, and while the British army wishes to dismiss the killing as another casualty of its war with France, Duncan discovers a pattern of ritualistic murders that have less to do with the war than with provincial treaty negotiations and struggles between tribal factions. Ultimately he realizes that to find justice, he must brave the sprawling colonial capital of Philadelphia. There the answers are to be found in a tangle of Quakers, Christian Indians, and a scientist obsessed with the electrical experiments of the celebrated Dr. Franklin. With the tragic resolution in sight, Duncan understands the real mysteries underlying his quest lie in the hearts of natives who, like his Highland Scots, have glimpsed the end of their world approaching.</p><p>*Starred Review* With a bounty on his head, courageous truth-seeker Duncan McCallum, indentured survivor of the British massacre of his Highland clan brutally conveyed to the New World in Bone Rattler (2007), undertakes another treacherous investigation. Like Shan, the Chinese inspector in Pattison&#x2019;s revelatory Tibetan mystery series, Duncan feels a profound connection to the imperiled indigenous people he meets, especially Conawago, a Nipmuc spiritual leader. He and Conawago are on a healing quest in the war-torn woodlands of the Iroquois Empire when they discover one in a series of ritualized murders involving surveyors and Indian shrine trees. Drawing on his passion for buried history and unique spiritual sensibility, Pattison turns a gripping mystery into a lens onto the North American conquest, bringing into focus the cruel complexity of the land grabs rampant in 1760 as conflicts intensify among various Indian tribes, the French, and the English; runaway slaves seek sanctuary; and Quakers strive for justice. Transcendent friendships, Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s experiments with electricity, and comic relief add dimension as Pattison maps the sacred geography of the woodlands and evokes the immense suffering of those who truly have the right to call them home. With high suspense and gritty lyricism, Pattison confronts mysteries human and cosmic. --Donna SeamanStarred Review. Few writers can combine history and mystery as well as Edgar-winner Pattison, as shown in the sequel to 2007's <i>Bone Rattler</i>, which introduced Duncan McCallum, a Scot who becomes an unlikely detective in 18th-century North America. In 1760, McCallum and his close friend, Conawago, a Jesuit-trained member of the Nipmuc tribe, stumble into a case with potentially far-reaching repercussions for a peace treaty between the Iroquois and the British. When the pair find a prominent Virginia militia commander, Winston Burke, nailed to a tree with a gear wheel stuck in his chest, Conawago becomes a suspect in the man's murder. Burke turns out to be but the latest victim of a killer who's targeted surveyors sent to map the Pennsylvania wilderness. While Burke's vengeful friends are eager for swift frontier justice, McCallum works frantically to uncover the truth. Evocative language, tight plotting, and memorable characters make this a standout. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. Burke exposes the obstacles in the way of post-abortion healing, reviews the full range and depth of post-abortion adjustment problems, and illustrates how we can create a more understanding and healing society where women will no longer be required to hide their pain.Abortion causes conflict. It fragments political parties, churches, schools, and neighborhoods. It divides families. Husband against wife. Mother against daughter. Sister against sister. <p>These conflicts reflect the discord that also occurs within individuals. After abortion, many women face a daily internal battle between condemning and defending themselves. </p><p>Psychotherapist Theresa Burke, PhD, has specialized in treating women struggling with post-abortion issues through individual counseling and group therapy sessions since 1986. Many of the women she treated had been rebuffed by other therapists who would not believe their abortions had caused such trauma. Others came to her because their family and friends refused to acknowledge the reality of their grief. </p><p>Drawing on the experience and insights of hundreds of her clients, Dr. Burke shows how repressed feelings may be acted out through self-destructive behavior, broken relationships, obsessions, eating disorders, parenting difficulties, and other emotional or behavioral problems. </p><p>"Forbidden Grief" also explains how to help loved ones, or yourself, simply by better understanding the nature and origin of unresolved abortion issues--and what steps will help you find healing.</p></p><h2>Alfie&#39;s Christmas</h2><p><p><b>Alfie has been charming children and parents for generations, but this is his very first Christmas</b></p> <p>A&nbsp;perfect gift, this beautiful storybook&nbsp;invites young readers to join&nbsp;Alfie and Annie Rose for Christmas, and covers every Christmas milestone.

The book features 28 mesmerizing projects, ranging from baby blankets and lace shawls to sweaters and stuffed toys, and also includes tutorials for the minimal skills required for center-out knitting, such as special cast-ons, increases, and decreases. Throughout the book are enlightening explanations of the underlying math and the architecture of the flat and dimensional shapes. Clear instructions and beautiful photography and illustrations assure that knitters of all levels and inclinations&#x2015;whether they are technique junkies or not&#x2015;will want to have this book.<br> <br> Praise for <i>Knitting From the Center Out:</i><br> <br> &#x201c;Though he delivers almost thirty projects in this premiere volume, Yuhas is just warming up. We'll be hearing more from him: Someday we'll look back and say, this is the book that launched a thousand cone hats.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Vogue Knitting</i><br> <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not often I find myself wanting to knit a whole bunch of projects from the same book, but there are plenty of things here that would be fun to explore in the knitting and that I&#x2019;d enjoy wearing and using as well. I&#x2019;d knit all the toys for my daughter.&#x201d; &#x2015;About.com<br> <br> &#x201c;Odd. Even geeky. Yet there&#x2019;s no question that Portland-based revolutionary knitter Yuhas is onto something. His premise is simple: start knitting at the middle/center of the item, which he categorizes into five shapes: tubes, cones, circles, domes, and ruffles. What&#x2019;s so odd? His mathematical sidebars (on Fibonacci, for instance) and a few titles in his recommended reading: Michael S. Schneider&#x2019;s <i>A Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Constructing the Universe</i> (1994), for one.&#x201d;<i> &#x2015;</i>Booklist Starred Review<br> <br> &#x201c;His passion for the topic is apparent, and adventurous knitters will appreciate the opportunity to learn something new here.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br> <br> &#x201c;Clear instructions and beautiful photography ensure that knitters of all levels and inclinations&#x2015;technique junkies or not&#x2015;will want this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Modern Day Moms<br> <br> &#x201c;We love the sorting hat . . .

He lives in Portland, Oregon, and regularly teaches at regional and national fiber festivals.<p></p>*Starred Review* Odd. Even geeky. Yet there&#x2019;s no question that Portland-based revolutionary knitter Yuhas is on to something. His premise is simple: start knitting at the middle/center of the item, which he categorizes into five shapes: tubes, cones, circles, domes, and ruffles. His tricks also seem uncomplicated, which means mastering the ins (and outs) of knitting in the round and casting on in the middle. In real-life needlework, however, it takes a bit of time to figure out the how-to&#x2019;s; at the end, Yuhas does give us excellent step-by-step photographic tutorials. His nearly 30 designs are a combination of wild and winsome, matter-of-fact and magnificent, like his foxglove boa and half-moon mittens, or the sorting hat (yes, Harry Potter) and geometric shrug. Toys, accessories, sweaters, shawls, blankets, and I-cord items each include color photographs, well written-out directions (no charts for Daniel), notes about possible variations, and sketches of specific techniques or ideas. What&#x2019;s so odd? His mathematical sidebars (on Fibonacci, for instance) and a few titles in his recommended reading: Michael S.

Rollins's observations range from the wry to the raucous in this blistering account of a six-year career with the band - a time marked by crazed fans, vicious cops, near-starvation, substance abuse, and mind numbing all-night drives. Rollins decided to revise this edition by adding a wealth of new photographs, a new foreword, and an afterword to include some "where-are-they-now" information on the people featured in the book. This new edition includes 40 previously unpublished black-and-white photographs from Rollins's private collection and show flyers by artist Raymond Pettibon.

Quart or pint? There are many different types of canning jars available, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Choose the right jar for the recipe. Home canners have a wide selection of jars from which to choose for food preservation. Larger jars come as either wide-mouth or regular-mouth. Wide- mouth jars are ideal for packing large pieces, such as whole peaches, into a jar. Regular-mouth jars are fine for recipes such as soups and sauces. Recipes often specify jar size. The following jars are the most widely available for home canners (l-r): </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> QUART JARS: Use these jars for any large food, such as whole tomatoes, or for a generous amount of a recipe, such as spaghetti sauce or soup for a crowd.<br><br> PINT JARS: The most versatile jar, this can hold nearly anything-smaller amounts of sauce, vegetables to serve a few people, and larger amounts of jam.<br><br> 8-OUNCE JELLY JARS: Usually with a quilted or other pattern on the side, these jars have straight sides for better freezing (no shoulders for freezing food to push up and break) and for getting every last bit of jam out of the jar.<br><br> 4-OUNCE JARS: Home-canned food doesn't last as long in the refrigerator as commercial products because no artificial preservatives are added. These small jars hold amounts you'll use up more quickly.<br><br> PLASTIC FREEZER JARS: Freezer jam stores well in plastic freezer containers and glass jars, but these plastic jars are just the right size, with no danger of cracking in the freezer.<br><br> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <b>Avoid vintage jars</b><br> Old canning jars with colored glass or spring-type lids are pretty collector pieces, but they shouldn't be used in modern canning. They have irregular sizes, may crack, and don't seal properly. For refrigerator-pickled foods that don't require heat processing, decorative glass jars work fine. Just make sure you sterilize them in almost-boiling water before filling. <br> </td></tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><p>Enjoy fresh flavors year-round with this fun and easy guide to home canning and preserving.</p><p>Get the most from your backyard garden or farmers' market finds with Better Homes and Gardens Can It!

Jung, Emma Jung, and Marie-Louise von Franz. A first-generation Jungian psychologist, she was an original member of the Psychological Club of Zurich and a founder of the Jung Institute in Zurich. She lectured extensively in Switzerland and England and wrote several books on C.&nbsp;G. Jung and Jungian psychology. <p> <b><i>The Animus</i></b>, in two volumes, presents a psychological analysis of the animus, gleaned from handwritten notes, typed manuscripts, previously published articles, the author's own drafts of her lectures, and notes taken by those present. Barbara Hannah tackled the theme of the animus with a comprehensiveness unsurpassed in Jungian literature. Her insights and vigor stem from personally grappling with her own animus, while integrating the experience and reflections of many psychotherapists who worked directly with C.&nbsp;G. Jung. </p><p> Authenticity and comprehensiveness were priorities in editing this work, as well as the preservation of the excellence and comprehensiveness of her work on the animus&#x2015;a most complex and vexing topic&#x2015;while retaining the wonderfully natural spirit of Barbara Hannah herself. </p><p> Themes include the case of the sixteenth-century nun, Jeanne Fery; the animus in the Book of Tobit (or Tobias); literature generally (the Bront�s in particular); and the meaning of the animus for modern women. </p><p> See also: <b><i>The Animus</i></b>, volume 2.

Reprinted and in current use by the U.S. Marine Corps as an official training manual, it details methods of self-defense, offensive close combat, combat shooting and crowd-control techniques in riot situations. Colonel Rex Applegate is widely regarded as the father of modern close combat and combat shooting, and this book is considered the standard by which all other books on the subject are judged.</p><p>Col. Rex Applegate was universally recognized as America&#39;s foremost authority on close combat with or without weapons.</p><h2>Living Among Headstones: Life in a Country Cemetery</h2><p>A few years ago, Shannon Applegate was bequeathed a small cemetery in western Oregon. The neglected five acres were not only the burial site for generations of her family and friends but the designated resting ground for many in the nearby, down-on-its-luck logging town. <i>Living Among Headstones</i> chronicles the author&#x2019;s experiences as she takes charge of this sacred land and finds herself plotting graves, consoling families, and confronting the funeral industry as she examines the universal question of why the living care so much about the earthly setting in which the dead are laid to rest.<br><br>Filled with humor, singular events, pathos, original illustrations, and unexpected smiles, this book offers historical asides and moving personal stories. For example, Shannon explores the language and customs of funerals as she agonizes over how to approach families who have covered graves with plastic flowers and inappropriate ornaments. In doing so, she contemplates the myriad ways cultures past and present approach the dead. In part, this is a book about rural cemeteries in contemporary America, but the sum is a meditation on how we long for those we love to have a continuing place in our world, focusing as much on life as death.</p><p>SHANNON APPLEGATE is also the author of Skookum: An Oregon Pioneer Family's History and Lore. She is the chair of Oregon's Commission on Historic Cemeteries and is active in the national cemetery preservation movement.

What makes it &#x201c;a weird one&#x201d; is the lack of any obvious motive, and the luridly careful staging of the murder scene&#x2014;which immediately suggests to Alex not an impulsive crime of passion . . . but the meticulous and taunting modus operandi of a serial killer. <br><br>Delaware&#x2019;s suspicion is borne out when he compares notes with Milo&#x2019;s associate, Petra Connor, and her new partner, a strange, taciturn detective with a past of his own named Eric Stahl. The Hollywood cops are investigating the vicious death of Baby Boy Lee, a noted blues guitarist, fatally stabbed after a late-night set at a local club. What links Baby Boy&#x2019;s murder with that of painter Juliet Kipper is the shadowy presence of an abrasive fanzine writer. This alias-shrouded critic&#x2019;s love-the-art/disdain-the-artist philosophy and his morbid fascination with the murders leads Alex and the detectives to suspect they&#x2019;re facing a new breed of celebrity stalker: one with a fetish for snuffing out rising stars.<br><br>Tracking down the killer proves to be maddening, with the twisting trail leading from halfway houses to palatial mansions and from a college campus to the last place Alex ever expected: the doorstep of his ex-lover Robin Castagna, whose business association with two of the victims casts her as an unavoidable player in the unfolding case. As more and more killings are discovered, unraveling the maddening puzzle assumes a chilling new importance&#x2014;stopping a vicious psychopath who&#x2019;s made cold-blood murder his chosen art form.</p><p>In <i>Cold Heart</i>, the latest thriller from bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman, Dr. Alex Delaware picks up on clues missed even by his closest friend, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis. Leave it to this canny shrink to figure out that the only thing two otherwise unconnected murder victims have in common (they're both artists making comebacks after early career burnouts) may hold the key to their deaths. Even for Alex, this unlikely link is a stretch, especially since Baby Boy Lee was stabbed outside a nightclub and Julie Kipper was bludgeoned in the bathroom of an art gallery. But when a concert pianist dies on the eve of his greatest triumph, Alex is sure that the murders are not only the work of the same killer but also connected to the unsolved slayings of a Boston ballerina and an L.A. rock singer. By an even greater coincidence, two of the victims were tangentially involved with Alex's former lover, Robin Castagna, which provides the good doctor a few well placed paragraphs to ruminate on what went wrong in their romance as well as rescue her from the serial murderer who's targeted her as his next victim.<p> As usual, Kellerman manages to make even a far-fetched plot like this one ring true, but after 17 Alex Delaware mysteries, his series protagonist holds few surprises for the reader, who longs for something to shake Dr. D. out of his smooth complacency. Losing Robin didn't do it--maybe the new woman in Alex's life will. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>&#x201c;Often, mystery writers can either plot like devils or create believable characters.

The author was a practicing attorney for many years but now writes full-time. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.<b>Bremen: First Mystic Druid<br></b><br>The first Druid to actually succeed in promoting the combination of the study of magic with other disciplines was the Druid Bremen. Unfortunately, he succeeded primarily because he and his followers were the only Druids to survive Paranor&#x2019;s fall during the Second War of the Races. Bremen is best known for his role in creating the legendary Sword of Shannara, a magic-imbued weapon he designed to defeat the Warlock Lord. <br><br>Abandoned by his parents shortly after birth, Bremen was raised by his grandfather, a skilled metalworker, who was probably responsible for both the boy&#x2019;s understanding of metallurgy and his dedication. Always searching for knowledge, Bremen was a student of history and ancient tongues, disciplines that made him an ideal candidate for the Druid Council. <br><br>He joined the council as a young man and became active in assisting in the evolution and development of the Races. Over time, he watched as the Druid Council began to pull back from the rest of the world, disillusioned by its failure to re-create the old sciences.<br><br>Frustrated by the setbacks, Bremen began to look to magic as a possible alternative. In his early journal entries, now part of the Druid Histories, Bremen wrote: &#x201c;Magic could provide a more manageable and durable form of power than that found through science. It has untapped potential beyond that of the sciences, even at the levels of scientific advancement found in the Old World.&#x201d;<br><br>At that time, the study of the arcane arts was permissible but discouraged. Magic was to be treated as a curiosity only, not a serious discipline. One group of Druids had already been exiled for their insistence on the use of magic as a tool to make the Druids the masters of all the Races. Bremen was warned against traversing the same path. The fact that magic had been used in the First War of the Races to ill effect did nothing to help his cause. He wrote, &#x201c;It is quite unnatural to me to discard a possibility simply because it has once failed. Do we discard science because we have failed to re-create the wonders of the Old World? Of course not. Why then discard magic just because it was once blatantly misused? If we discard every possibility that is not immediately successful, we are left with no possibilities at all.&#x201d; He believed that magic could be harnessed and controlled with enough discipline and training. <br><br>A few of his fellows apparently agreed with him, but they were in the minority. Unwilling to risk censure, they backed away from the matter. Bremen did not. Eventually his insistence on considering magic a valid and serious alternative to science earned him banishment from the council.<br><br>After his banishment, Bremen traveled to the Westland to study with the Elves, where he lived for many years. He believed the Elven libraries, which had the greatest collection of ancient writings in lost Elven dialects, held the secret to understanding the old magic from the time of Faerie. The Elves embraced Bremen and his search, since they too were interested in rediscovering abilities that had been lost. Certain magics, such as some degree of the Druid Sleep, were skills Bremen already practiced. But with his knowledge of ancient tongues, he was able to uncover treasures of magical lore and decipher otherwise discarded texts that increased his knowledge and abilities far beyond what he would have gained at Paranor. <br><br>Inspired from his years of success with the Elves, Bremen left them to travel to other lands, seeking whatever lost bits of magic he could find, in much the same way as the early Druids had searched out the texts and lore related to the Old World sciences. According to his journals, he found an amazing amount of lost magic, though none as greatly concentrated or as highly developed as that within the Westland. In many cases, the magic he found was completely foreign to those who used it. <br><br>At some point in his travels, probably while in the Southland, Bremen began to suspect that the First War of the Races had not actually been organized by the Race of Men who appeared to have started it. He found evidence that the leader&#x2013;referred to only as Brona, which means &#x201c;master&#x201d; in Gnome dialect&#x2013;who had long been thought by the Druids of his order to be a mythic figurehead, was in fact a real being. Bremen suspected he was the leader of the Druids who had broken from the council and renounced their brotherhood over the question of magic many years before. He also found evidence that Brona was still alive, despite the impossible number of years that had passed, and was planning another assault on the Four Lands.<br><br>Unlike the rest of the Druids, Bremen had no trouble believing Brona could still be alive, because his own life had been lengthened beyond a natural span by his use of the Druid Sleep. But he knew he would have to have proof before the council would believe him.<br><br>He spent the next several years tracking the elusive Brona, going so far as to travel to the Skull Kingdom. Upon his return to Paranor, both Bremen and his information were rejected by the council. He left with only the few who believed his warning of impending attack. Shortly after his visit, Paranor fell to the armies of the Warlock Lord, betrayed from within. Bremen and those who left with him&#x2013;the Dwarf Warrior Druid Risca, the Elf Tay Trefenwyd, and the apprentice Mareth&#x2013;were the only survivors of the order. <br><br>Before he left, Bremen provided the magic that saved the Druid Histories from the invaders. The opened portion of the Druid Histories also credits him for preventing a long-term occupation by the Warlock Lord by triggering the magic of the Druid&#x2019;s Well.<br><br>By default, the death of the Druids left Bremen as the acting High Druid. But while he did rescue the Elit Druin after Paranor&#x2019;s fall, he never formally accepted the title. He used the medallion in the forging of the Sword of Shannara, the magical weapon used to end the Second War of the Races and the War of the Warlock Lord.<br><br>Of the Druids who followed Bremen from Paranor, only Mareth survived the war. She declined to complete her training as a Druid, leaving Bremen as the last of the Druids, even as he was the first to successfully balance magic with the good of the Races. He adopted a young man known only as Allanon, whom he had befriended during the war, and took him as apprentice, heir, and eventually son. <br><br>Paranor vanished only a few years after the war, and some scholars now believe that Bremen, with his knowledge of magics, was responsible for that disappearance.<br><br>While many consider Bremen to have died approximately three years after the end of the Second War of the Races, Allanon&#x2019;s journal records that he did not die, but instead &#x201c;doomed himself to an existence of half-life that may not end for all eternity&#x201d; by entering the mysterious Hadeshorn. This interpretation is also found within the diaries of Brin Ohmsford, where she records seeing an apparition that was identified as Bremen while at the Chard Rush, decades after Bremen&#x2019;s supposed death.</p><h2>The Anthology Part 1</h2><p><p>The first five years were filled with high adventure, with dreams coming true, with new friendships beginning and old friendships growing. Most of all, though, the years were filled with music being made. We thought about songs night and day, chased the things. I was surrounded by songwriters, musicians, producers, engineers, managers, by people who lived to make music, and we got to see the world through songs. There were a lot of firsts, one after another: First time leaving Oklahoma for Nashville, first time hearing one of our songs on the radio, first time hitting number one. We won&#x2019;t ever get to go through all those firsts again, but this book is my chance to get together with the people who shared the experiences and together remember how it all went down. This book gathers what comes to our minds when we think of the first five years and the songs that came to life during that time.</p><p>Inside these pages you&#x2019;ll find the music that got released in those first five years, five CDs of it. But you&#x2019;ll also find a few recordings that we&#x2019;ve never shared, some of my favorites. You&#x2019;ll find photographs that have never been made public, behind-the-scenes images from before the first record and others from during the journey. There are artifacts from the vaults, things I&#x2019;ve saved myself, bits and pieces of this history that mean a lot to me. I&#x2019;ve always wanted to bring people closer to what I saw, what I experienced. This feels like the closest I&#x2019;ve come to doing just that. </p> - Garth</p><p></p><h2>The Sweet Spot: How to Find Your Groove at Home and Work</h2><p><b>Learn how to achieve more by doing less!

The real exception is to truly live."<br>&#x2014;�Lee Lipsenthal, Enjoy Every Sandwich<br><br> A doctor friend of mine, Lee Lipsenthal, was dying from cancer, leaving children and a beloved wife behind. He came to our monthly Buddhism and neuroscience study group one last time to share what his impending death had taught him. Imagine you&#x2019;ve just been told that you have less than six months to live, Lee said to us.<br><br> What do you need to do?<br><br> Whom do you need to talk to?<br><br> Where do you need to visit?<br><br> How will you spend your remaining time?<br><br> As I visualized my life with a terminal illness, on the precipice of my own death, I was profoundly struck by how totally out of whack my (real) life had become. In fact, my primary reaction to Lee&#x2019;s death meditation was that I would feel relieved to be dying.<br><br> This realization was shocking and, frankly, embarrassing. Lee understood, but imagine how insulting this sentiment could have been to him. He would have given anything to be as healthy as I was. It wasn&#x2019;t that I was unhappy with my life&#x2014;�far from it. But I was overwhelmed by it. My imagined impending death released me from the stresses of everyday life. It&#x2019;s obvious to me now that I needed a break&#x2014;�a figurative and literal recess during which I could recharge my proverbial batteries.<br><br> The trouble was (and is for so many) that I saw no way to take that break without giving something up. I did not see any ways to free up time for rest and reflection, nor did I see ways that I could simplify or reorganize my life for greater ease and less strain. But now I do.<br><br> The first part of the &#x201c;sweet spot equation&#x201d;&#x2014;�Take Recess&#x2014;�is about starting to breathe easier right away by giving yourself tiny moments to recharge throughout the day. I know, I know: You&#x2019;re really busy. Too busy to take any sort of break, much less &#x201c;recess.&#x201d; Bear with me.<br><br> Full Plate, Empty Life<br><br> Everyone asks: How are you? And everyone answers: I am so busy.<br><br> &#x201c;We say this to one another with no small degree of pride,&#x201d; writes Wayne Muller in his treatise on rest, &#x201c;as if our exhaustion were a trophy, our ability to withstand stress a real mark of character. The busier we are, the more important we seem to ourselves and, we imagine, to others.&#x201d; Have you ever bought into this self-�fulfilling prophecy? When we start to feel worthwhile because of our busyness, we start to believe the corollary: If I&#x2019;m not busy, I&#x2019;m not worthwhile.<br><br> Most of our modern tasks are what researchers call &#x201c;instrumental.&#x201d; They aren&#x2019;t fun; they are productive, stuff we &#x201c;should&#x201d; do, tasks to cross off of a list. The trouble comes when we eliminate the fun stuff in our lives, when play and rest get eliminated and we use a &#x201c;get &#x2019;er done approach&#x201d; to instrumental work. This trouble is best illuminated by a famous study by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of Flow.<br><br> Csikszentmihalyi unintentionally induced textbook cases of generalized anxiety disorder in people simply by instructing his subjects as follows: From the time you wake up until 9:00&nbsp;p.m., he explained, &#x201c;We would like you to act in a normal way, doing all the things you have to do, but not doing anything that is &#x2018;play&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-�instrumental.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> Research subjects could make the beds and wash the dishes, drive the carpool, go to work, come home and make dinner, supervise homework and bedtime&#x2014;�any of this sounding familiar?&#x2014;�skipping those moments of enjoyment in the day that bring flow or rest. They avoided those things at work they found especially gratifying, skipped the lovely breather they&#x2019;d take when the kids were off to school, refrained from juicy-�but-�not-�productive sex.<br><br> Following these instructions for just forty-�eight hours produced symptoms of serious anxiety in research subjects&#x2014;�restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension&#x2014;�all by eliminating flow and play from their lives. In other words, we get anxious when we aren&#x2019;t having any fun. Management consultant and author Dan Pink writes about what happened to these particular research subjects:<br><br> The results were almost immediate. Even at the end of the first day, participants &#x201c;noticed an increased sluggishness about their behavior.&#x201d; They began complaining of headaches. Most reported difficulty concentrating, with &#x201c;thoughts [that] wander round in circles without getting anywhere.&#x201d; Some felt sleepy, while others were too agitated to sleep. As Csikszentmihalyi wrote, &#x201c;After just two days of deprivation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the general deterioration in mood was so advanced that prolonging the experiment would have been unadvisable.&#x201d;<br><br> When we strip our lives of play and flow&#x2014;�as we so often do just to get everything done&#x2014;�our mood deteriorates. Here&#x2019;s the thing: A life made up of only &#x201c;instrumental&#x201d; tasks was an experimental anomaly for research subjects in the 1970s, when Csikszentmihalyi&#x2019;s study was run, but it has become the norm for many people today. Fun, rest, relaxation, and flow have been squeezed out of our lives in the pursuit of more. More sports and lessons for our kids (so that they can get into the best schools and get the best jobs when they graduate), and more work (so that we can keep our jobs, or we can earn more money so we can buy more stuff). We are poisoned by the hypnotic belief, writes Muller, that &#x201c;good things come only through unceasing determination and tireless effort,&#x201d; and so &#x201c;we can never truly rest.&#x201d;<br><br> Case in point: On May&nbsp;14, 2013, a twenty-�four-�year-�old &#x201c;ad man&#x201d; named Gabriel Li died of a sudden heart attack at his Ogilvy&nbsp;&amp; Mather Beijing office. The official cause of death? Overwork. He&#x2019;d been working overtime most days the month prior to his death, leaving the office at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. He was at his desk when he died. Though the American advertising agency where he was employed denied that his death was linked to overwork, Li will be counted by the Chinese government among the estimated 600,000 people in China who die from work-�related exhaustion each year.<br><br> Deaths like Li&#x2019;s are a global problem. The Japanese call sudden death due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease karoshi, which means &#x201c;death from overwork.&#x201d; Sudden cardiac arrest related to overwork happens in all industrialized nations. Stressed and exhausted employees are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease. Cortisol, a hormone that is released when we are stressed, is a chief culprit, as it causes the arteries to narrow.<br><br> The Alternative: Produce&#x2014;�and Grow&#x2014;�Like Olive Trees<br><br> My great-�grandparents grew olives, and my brother runs the olive processing company they started, so I&#x2019;ve learned a lot about olives over the years. Olives are an &#x201c;alternate bearing crop,&#x201d; which means that they grow a lot of fruit one year, then mostly branches the following year, creating what is called a &#x201c;short crop.&#x201d; They produce less fruit in year one in order to produce a large crop in year two. We can all learn from the olive tree. In addition to being a symbol of peace, olives are also a metaphor for how rest and rejuvenation are essential to productivity.<br><br> In today&#x2019;s hyper-�busy world, most people don&#x2019;t rest or rejuvenate much. We don&#x2019;t allow ourselves the &#x201c;non-�instrumental&#x201d; activities in life. Research does find that consistent and deliberate practice leads to elite performance (see Chapter 8 for more on that). But focused work is not the same as unending work. Even Olympic athletes must train and rest or they get hurt. Fruit trees forced to produce for more than one season, without being allowed to rest in the winter, lose their ability to bear fruit altogether.<br><br> In our fast-�paced and technology-�driven culture, we (and our employers) sometimes forget that we are humans, not computers. Like other animals, humans are governed by circadian and ultradian rhythms. Most people are familiar with the concept of our circadian rhythms. In the twenty-�four-�hour period when the sun rises and sets, we sleep and wake in predictable cycles. When we travel into different time zones, our circadian rhythms get out of whack, and as a consequence, our lives also can feel similarly discombobulated.<br><br> Our brains and bodies also cycle in &#x201c;ultradian rhythms&#x201d; throughout the day and night. An ultradian rhythm is a recurrent period or cycle that repeats throughout the twenty-�four-�hour circadian day, like breathing or our heartbeat.<br><br> Even in our sleep, we don&#x2019;t just exist in a singular, steady state. We cycle between dreaming and various types of non-�dreaming sleep. There are five different stages of the sleep cycle, each stage identifiable by different brain-�wave patterns. For example, Stage 1 sleep is characterized by slow theta waves, while Stage 4 sleep, which is deep and dreamless, is characterized by even slower delta waves.<br><br> Our brain-�wave patterns also cycle when we are awake. About every hour and a half to two hours, we experience a significant &#x201c;ultradian dip,&#x201d; when our energy drops and sleep becomes possible. When we work through these dips&#x2014;�relying on caffeine, adrenaline, and stress hormones to keep us alert instead of letting our bodies and brains rest, we become anxious and jittery, and our performance falters.<br><br> When we ignore our body&#x2019;s natural rhythms, we create a state of chronic jet lag for ourselves, which over time leads to clinical levels of depression and anxiety, stress-�related diseases, and myriad substance-�abuse problems (as we self-�medicate to stay alert and to &#x201c;rest&#x201d;). As Wayne Muller writes in his book A Life of Being, Having, and Doing Enough:<br><br> When we are increasingly drained, pressed for time, and afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are inclined to grasp for some substitute. We are more easily seduced by certain behaviors or possessions that promise to give us not precisely what we dreamed, but something that looks close enough. Most importantly, it is always the thing we can get easier, cheaper, and faster, in an increasingly busy life&#x2014;�in the bone-�weary ache of our exhausted heart&#x2014;�and this kind of swift comfort can become irresistible.<br><br> Unfortunately, as our time and energy are spent more singularly on work, our plate gets too full to enjoy what is on it (or falling off of it).<br><br> Finding the &#x201c;Minimum Effective Dose&#x201d;<br><br> When we live our lives as though we are running one marathon after another, day after day, it is, frankly, impossible for life to feel anything but difficult. We know this about actual marathons; there is a whole protocol that runners go through when they finish a race so they can recover. They have medical and other support to begin repairing the damage to their bodies, and they know to rest for weeks or even months between races. Yet we don&#x2019;t have parallel support systems in place for our daily &#x201c;marathons.&#x201d;<br><br> Instead of running one &#x201c;marathon&#x201d; after another with little recovery time between them, we can learn to honor the natural rhythms of our days and our lives. We can live more like olive trees, which produce olives for hundreds of years, than like our iPhones, which are built to last only a couple of years. We can take a school day approach to life, in which we work and learn and produce and create in predictable periods of time, and then we have equally predictable periods of play and rest and recovery. As in school, we take recess.<br><br> There&#x2019;s one more thing that we can learn from marathoners and olive trees: Our most productive pace is always the most consistent one. When we are producing and creating&#x2014;�when runners are in a race and when trees are growing fruit in the summer and when authors like me are writing a book&#x2014;�we are most successful when we are consistent in our efforts. Long-�distance runners (and even sprinters) are more likely to win a race if they run each mile at a consistent pace. Expeditioners&#x2014;�people who walk across America&#x2014;�are more likely to succeed, and finish far more quickly, when they walk or trek the same distance day after day, rain or shine. This means they try to trek twenty miles on hard days when the weather is bad and the mileage is all uphill, and&#x2014;�this is the clincher&#x2014;�they stop after twenty miles on easy days, when the weather is mild and the terrain is downhill. Instead of cramming&#x2014;�working long hours and late nights before a big project is due&#x2014;�we human beings do best when we make consistent, predictable, daily progress.<br><br> These insights have translated in a few ways in my work. First, the type of work I do cycles like the seasons. Some seasons I focus on writing. Once a book or an article is written, I rest and explore new topics, turning my attention to less taxing work, and I take several weeks off and don&#x2019;t write at all. This is my cycle of creation and rest. In addition, when I&#x2019;m in a production cycle, I write consistently, 650 to 1,000 words a day. I try to write this amount even on hard days, when I am traveling or have a lot of meetings or my kids are home from school. And on easy days&#x2014;�when I&#x2019;ve blocked off six full hours of uninterrupted time to write&#x2014;�I stop once I hit the 1,000-�word mark. For me, it is more difficult to stop writing on easy days than it is to churn out 650 words (basically just one rough page) on a hard day. But here&#x2019;s the thing: I&#x2019;ve found that if I write more than 1,000 words a couple of days in a row, by the third day, the writing becomes rather joyless. Actually, it can be excruciating. I feel like I&#x2019;m trying to squeeze water from a dry sponge. If I finish my 1,000 words and still have time to write, I let myself edit, or I do research&#x2014;�both things that I find easy and joyful and that set me up for success the next day. And ultimately, I know I&#x2019;m not slowing myself down&#x2014;�that I can complete a book in about six months (my spring and summer fruit production) at this consistent and very manageable pace.<br><br> When we take the approach of trees and successful runners and expeditioners, we find that we are able to live with both strength and ease. We free up time and energy to re-energize, to connect, and to find real and deep meaning.<br><br> Let me tell you, life seems pretty sweet to me these days, and not because I&#x2019;m Oprah-�rich and doted on by a support staff. I frequently have profound feelings that life is really, really good. I still feel astonished that even though I&#x2019;m not working the long hours I used to, I&#x2019;m more financially independent and secure. Consider that:<br><br> Every morning this week I rose from bed without feeling the need to press the snooze button. After a quick trip to the loo, I did a lovely meditation and then went for a short run or did a seven-�minute strength-�training circuit.<br><br> After showering and eating breakfast, I got my writing brain warmed up by reading several articles I&#x2019;d clipped from various online sources&#x2014;�emails, academic journals, a couple different blogs and online magazines. I had more time than I needed to do this, so it felt luxurious to read and drink my coffee.<br><br> After getting the kids off to school, because I&#x2019;d been pondering what I wanted to write in an unfocused way as I showered and ate breakfast, when I sat myself down in front of a huge blank pad, ideas poured out of me in an easy, non-�linear way. I outlined this chapter in about ten minute...</p><h2>God&#39;s Life in Trinity</h2><p>J�rgen Moltmann&#39;s distinctive insights in trinitarian theology - especially about the relations within God and God&#39;s presence in creation - are revolutionary for theology and set the stage for these further explorations.

Now they had to stop riding, for Curly Jack was dying on their hands. <br>They eased him to the warm ground beneath the thin shade of a mesquite. Because the sun still came through, Dencil Fox unsaddled Curly Jack's horse and draped the wet saddle blanket across the branches to deepen the shade. Dencil poured water from a canteen into a handkerchief and gently touched it to Jack's fevered face. <br>"You just need to rest a spell, pardner," he said. "You'll be all right directly." <br>But he knew he was lying. There was the smell of gangrene about Curly Jack--the smell of death. <br>He wondered how Jack had managed to stay in the saddle as long as he had. It wasn't such a bad wound, they had thought. A bullet high in the shoulder, nothing fatal. But they hadn't dared hunt for a doctor. And the posse hadn't given them much chance to probe for the bullet the first couple of days. When at last they'd had time for Dencil to try, he hadn't been able to extract the slug. If anything, his efforts had made things worse. <br>Jack weakly motioned toward the canteen, and Dencil touched it to his lips, lifting Jack's head. <br>The other three men stood around uncomfortably, a deep weariness in their eyes, the droop of their shoulders. They were dusty and bearded. The oldest two were silent, but the youngest began to complain. <br>"We could have left him off someplace the first day. They'd have found him and took care of him." <br>Dencil Fox frowned quickly at his younger brother, then looked back at Curly Jack. "They'd have taken care of him, all right. Jack had rather go this way than at the end of a rope." <br>"If he was goin' to die anyhow, at least we wouldn't have been saddled down with him." <br>Sharply Dencil said, "Shut up, Buster!" He knew Curly Jack could still hear all that was said. <br>Buster kept talking. "If he'd shot that bank teller, he wouldn't have caught a slug himself." <br>Dencil said, "We didn't go in there to kill anybody." <br>"You <i>didn't</i> kill anybody. And you didn't get any money, either." <br>"We didn't figure on that gutty teller. And we never did know where he got that gun so fast." <br>Buster Fox said bitterly, "Leavin' me outside to hold the horses&#x2026;If I'd been in there, things would've been a right smart different." <br>"That's why we left you outside." <br>"Well, you won't leave me outside next time!" <br>Curly Jack died without ever speaking a word. Because there was no shovel, they had to carry him to an arroyo, roll him in his saddle blanket, and cave a steep bank in on top of him. This way, at least, no one was likely to find him for a while. Later, if a rise came down the arroyo and washed the body out into the open, the four riders would be so far gone that the discovery would not put them in danger. <br>Dencil Fox stood with hat in hand, gravely looking down on the pile of fresh-caved earth at the bottom of the arroyo. <br>"Mighty poor way to leave you, Jack." His voice was sorrowful. "No marker, no preacher to read over you." <br>Buster spoke dryly, "Jack wasn't exactly the church-goin' kind." <br>Dencil said, "He was a good man, and don't you forget it." <br>"Too bad he wasn't a good shot." <br>They rode on then, leading Jack's horse for an extra, putting miles between them and the place where the fifth outlaw had died. <br>In time Dencil Fox said, "We got to find us a good spot to lay over. These horses will die under us if we don't rest them a few days." <br>A tall rider named Hackberry said, "We crossed the railroad tracks late yesterday. I figure we're about halfway between Grafton and Swallowfork. There's a big draw runs through a ways this side of Swallowfork. With the wet spring they had here, there ought to be good grass in it, and plenty of water. We could camp there as long as we wanted. Ain't anybody apt to see us except maybe a stray cowpuncher or two." <br>Dencil said, "You don't reckon they've heard about that bank job?" <br>"That was a long ways off. Last time I was in Swallowfork, it didn't have no telegraph or nothin'. Who'd be lookin' for us down here?" <br>"Nobody, I reckon. And I could sure use me a good rest." <br>The younger Fox pushed his horse up close to Hackberry's. "What kind of a town is this Swallowfork? Chance a man could find himself a little entertainment?" <br>Hackberry said, "The kind you're lookin' for?" He shook his head. "Last time I was there it was just a dull lookin' little cowtown. You could get yourself somethin' to drink and maybe a quiet game of cards, low limit. Nothin' fancy. And no wheeligo girls." <br>Buster was plainly disappointed. "Ain't that a shame!" Then, his face brightened again. "I wonder if they got a bank&#x2026;" <br>* * * <br>A loud clatter was going on at the shack's old cast-iron cookstove. <br>"If you don't quit polishin' that tin star and go chop some firewood, there won't be any breakfast!" <br>Sitting on the edge of his cot, Jim-Bob McClain turned about with a youthfully sheepish grin and waved a hand at the young man who had spoken. "Hold your horses, Dan. I'll get to it directly." He pinned the deputy badge on his left shirt pocket, catching the Bull Durham sack with the pin the first time he tried. He reached down and pulled on his long-eared, high-heeled boots. He already had his hat on. It was the first thing he looked for when he got up of a morning: an old cowboy habit he had developed sleeping on the ground in wintertime, dressing from the head downward as he worked up out of the warm blankets. <br>Dan Singleton stood at the black stove, poking remnant woodchips in on top of the reluctant flame he coaxed out of dry kindling. Ashes filtered out around the sprung door and fell at his feet. "Thought this was your week to chop the wood," Dan prodded Jim-Bob good-naturedly. "Or do I have to call out the law?" <br>"I meant to do it last night, but with the dance down at Sothera's barn and all, I flat forgot." <br>"Then you better get at it, or it's goin' to be a long, hungry day." <br>Jim-Bob walked out of the little frame shack and paused to enjoy the clean freshness of the early morning. This was the summertime's best hour in the West Texas range country, just at sunup. The cool air of a brand new day braced a man and gave him vigor, made him imagine he could ride horseback a hundred miles without his shoulders ever sagging. It gave him all manner of grand ambition, notions the noonday heat would later bake out of him. <br>Along the wagon road just hollering distance away lay the beginnings of the town of Swallowfork. A scattering of frame and adobe houses first, thickening up and bunching closer together the nearer they lay to the rock courthouse and jail and the dozen or so business buildings that made up the core, it sprawled out haphazardly like a big <i>remuda</i> of horses loose-herded across half of a valley. <br>Jim-Bob listened. About all he could hear was a couple of roosters crowing the sun up, and a shut-in milkpen calf bawling for its mammy. <br>Quiet town, most of the time. Sleepy livestock town, drawing its livelihood from the good rolling rangeland that lay about it; from the tall bunch grasses that made the hillsides wave green in the gentle south breeze; from the valley's short, tough curly-mesquite buffalo grass; from the leggy, longhorned cattle that roamed and grazed there; and from the scattering bands of free-ranging sheep that were edging in on the cowman's domain, winning him over by pressure of economics if not from liking for the animal. <br>Quiet town it was, but one with ambitions, and one with a future. Jim-Bob's town. Like the town, he had ambitions. He could only hope <i>he</i> had a future, too. <br>He stood with hands shoved deep in his pockets, jingling the coins he carried there. Pay from his first month as a deputy sheriff of Coldridge County. He had hoped and worked and planned for a long time to pin that badge on his shirt. Now he had it. <br>"Jim-Bob," Dan Singleton's impatient voice insisted through the open door, "how about that wood?" <br>"Comin'." <br>A big red dog, ugly as a mud fence, sidled around the shack and came up wagging his tail. "Mornin', Ranger," Jim-Bob greeted him, patting his broad head. "Where'd you spend the night? Liable to be a scandal around here if you don't take to stayin' home." <br>Jim-Bob unwedged the ax from the big mesquite limb that served as a chopping block and pulled a smaller limb down from the woodpile. He and Dan Singleton had taken a couple of Sunday afternoons and a borrowed wagon to haul in this supply of dry wood from a brushy draw a ways out of town. His strong back and hard-muscled arms made short work of the wood. In a few minutes he walked into the shack with a good armload. <br>"Hope you didn't cut it too long this time," Dan said. He had once accused Jim-Bob of trying to do such a poor job of it that Dan would take over in disgust. He wasn't far wrong. Jim-Bob never did go much for wood-chopping and the like. He preferred something he could do a-horse-back. But a man who made up his mind to live in town and be a deputy sheriff also had to make up his mind to do some menial chores he didn't care for. <br>Outside for another armload of wood, Jim-Bob paused to squint down the south wagon road that led in from Dry Creek and from ranches like the C Bar. There, in the reddish glow of the sun just up, he saw two riders trotting their horses purposefully toward town. Recognizing them, he waved. <br>"You-all come on over and have breakfast with us," he called. <br>They only acknowledged his offer with a quick wave of their hands and rode on. By the rigid way they sat their saddles, Jim-Bob could tell they meant business. He frowned and looked down at rusty-hided old Ranger, who had moved out a little way to size up the pair. "Somethin' the matter, Ranger. They've had to ride half the night to get in from the C Bar. And they're both packin' guns." <br>The way the country had settled up and closed in, folks weren't wearing their guns much anymore. When they did, it was usually because they felt a genuine need for them. <br>"Now what would Walter Chapman and Tom Singleton be needin' with guns?" he mused. <br>Walter Chapman ow...</p><h2>Go Down Moses</h2><p><p>&#x201c;I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail.

Urban streams were perceived as little more than flood control devices designed to hurry water through cities and neighborhoods with scant thought for aesthetics or ecological considerations. Stream restoration pioneers like hydrologist Ann Riley thought differently. She and other like-minded field scientists imagined that by restoring ecological function, and with careful management, streams and rivers could be a net benefit to cities, instead of a net liability. In the intervening decades, she has spearheaded numerous urban stream restoration projects and put to rest the long-held misconception that degraded urban streams are beyond help.<br><br> What has been missing, however, is detailed guidance for restoration practitioners wanting to undertake similar urban stream restoration projects that worked with, rather than against, nature. This book presents the author&#x2019;s thirty years of practical experience managing long-term stream and river restoration projects in heavily degraded urban environments. Riley provides a level of detail only a hands-on design practitioner would know, including insights on project design, institutional and social context of successful projects, and how to avoid costly and time-consuming mistakes. Early chapters clarify terminology and review strategies and techniques from historical schools of restoration thinking.

She lives in Toronto with the writer Graeme Gibson.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by David Liss You can't say no one saw it coming. Margaret Atwood did. Frankly, I don't even want to know when she wrote this book. Either Atwood -- unlike, say, Alan Greenspan -- predicted the global economic meltdown a long time ago, long enough to write the book and see it through the slow conveyer belt of publication, or she wrote it so recently and so quickly that my head would spin with jealousy and wonder. Payback is a delightfully engaging, smart, funny, clever and terrifying analysis of the role debt plays in our culture, our consciousness, our economy, our ecology and, if Atwood is right, our future. At the beginning of the book, she presents her work as an inquiry into "debt as a human construct -- thus an imaginative construct -- and how this construct mirrors and magnifies both voracious human desire and ferocious human fear." If this sound dry and forbidding, have no worries. Atwood breezily approaches her subject with anecdotes, memories and references ranging from Plato to Star Trek. If Scrooge is too highbrow for you, just hang in there and she'll woo you with a trenchant analysis of Scrooge McDuck. Atwood, a Canadian novelist and woman of letters, is interested in debt as a large concept, a thread that worms its way through all aspects of human life: our psychology, religions, relationships and, of course, finances. She goes back to ancient worship to show how, in the afterlife, the soul's status was valued using models of credit and debit. The word for sin and debt, Atwood observes, are the same in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus. Indeed, she points out how the language of debt permeates religious and moral discourse. Jesus comes to earth to redeem sinners. Criminals go to prison to pay their debts to society. There is, she says, a whole language of financial exchange embedded in our moral compasses. As for why this should be so, Atwood relies on a couple of pillars to prop up her argument. First, she sees narrative as central to human consciousness, and narrative works in terms of debits and credits. If motivations and desires can be reduced to a credit and debit system, then the stories we tell -- and she finds plenty of examples from Marlowe, Dickens, George Eliot and countless others -- are often literally, and always metaphorically, about the human desire to even things up. "Without story," she writes, "there is no debt," but the argument appears to work both ways. Without debt, there is no story. This point leads to the second, and perhaps more sturdy, pillar of her argument: management of debt is an exercise in fairness. One of the metaphors to which she returns frequently is that of an experiment done with capuchin moneys who are rewarded for performing simple tasks with a piece of cucumber. Then some of the monkeys begin receiving grapes -- a more prized food -- for performing the same task. Soon none of the monkeys is willing to work, because once they view their labor as worth grapes, there's no way they are going to expend their energy if all they are going to get is a lousy cucumber. What we most want, says Atwood, is to be treated fairly or, better yet, more than fairly -- but never unfairly; that is not acceptable. At times it seems to be Atwood's own notion of unfair treatment that motivates this book. Not her personal grievances, of course, but her perception of global imbalances, her feelings of cosmic injustice when she looks upon those who get all the grapes and the dangerous resentment brewing among those who are lucky even to get cucumbers. If systems, from personal relationships to global financial markets, operate on the assumption of basic fairness, then what happens when actors cannot or will not repay their debts? As we've seen with investment giants over-leveraged with bad derivatives, everything begins to break down, including the illusions that once held things together. Early in Payback, Atwood recalls learning about banks and interest as a child, at first finding them as mysterious as the tooth fairy. "If I stopped believing in banks, would they too expire?" she wondered. Later in the book, she observes that "when people lose faith in the value of a currency . . . money simply melts away, like the illusion it always has been." These are scary times for this sort of observation. Financial chaos, global warming, food shortages, environmental degradation and the possible extinction of the human race are all potential results of a monumental credit imbalance. A small number of people have way too many grapes. Inequity is reaching a boiling point, and on human, national, economic and environmental fronts, we are setting ourselves up for some monumental payback. It's scary stuff, but lucky for us it is also extremely entertaining. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.</p><h2>Asi Se Dice!

Mutt and Jeff had many memorable moments of serious goofiness and irreverence. Here&#x2019;s a rediscovery of a true oddball classic maybe only outdone by the antic high living of its own creator.</p><p>Burne Hogarth (Author) :Mutt and Jeff was the first successful daily comic strip; before it, the funnies were Sunday features. It debuted in 1907, however, as A. Mutt, limning the follies of lanky racetrack gambler Augustus Mutt. Diminutive sidekick Jeff appeared the following year to form a partnership that lasted until the strip's overdue demise in 1983. Mutt and Jeff was the first strip to essay weeks-long story lines, such as a trip to Mexico to join Pancho Villa's revolution. Compared to better-remembered strips of the era, Mutt and Jeff was crudely drawn, yet it captured the nation's fancy. Despite its significance in comics history, Mutt and Jeff is scantly regarded today. By the mid-1920s, Fisher handed creative duties over to ghosts to free up time for the playboy lifestyle that the strip's sizable revenues allowed him. Unlike such more prestigious classic strips as Gasoline Alley and Dick Tracy, Mutt and Jeff doesn't warrant comprehensive reprinting. This selection of episodes from 1909&#x2013;13 represents it quite sufficiently.

The Franklin was a creation of World War II, one of twenty-four Essex-class fast carriers built during the conflict, forming the backbone of the U.S. Navy's war against Japan.<br><br> By the time the war had moved to Okinawa in the spring of 1945, "Big Ben" had already seen substantial combat, having participated in the island campaigns of the central and western Pacific and the Battle for Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, where she sustained heavy damage from the new and deadly Japanese <i>kamikaze</i>.<br><br> On March 19, 1945, the Franklin was launching her aircraft against Honshu, the Japanese mainland, including the shipping industry in Kobe Harbor. Suddenly, a single enemy aircraft pierced the cloud cover and made a low level run on the ship, striking it with a 250kg bomb which pierced the deck and set off a chain reaction of exploding ordnance and aviation fuel.<br><br> The aircraft carrier, now on fire, listing heavily to starboard, and with over 1,000 casualties, appeared to be mortally wounded. <i>Inferno</i> tells the heroic tale of the efforts that saved "Big Ben." It is a tremendous story of endurance and seamanship, told in harrowing detail in the survivors own words.<i> Inferno</i> makes for gripping reading.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Off Japan, on March 19th, 1945, a Japanese dive-bomber struck the&nbsp;USS Franklin. The aircraft carrier, on fire and listing to&nbsp;starboard,&nbsp;appeared to be mortally wounded. This book tells the heroic tale of the efforts that went into saving the Franklin. In the survivors&#x2019; words, the story of the ship&#x2019;s arduous journey from Okinawa to the Brooklyn Navy Yard unfolds. It is a tremendous tale of endurance and seamanship, told in harrowing detail.</p><p><b>Author&#x2019;s Note</b></p> <p>In writing oral histories, it is inevitable that events are recalled differently&#x2014;memories are informed by the personal views of witnesses and by where those witnesses were during an engagement. An eighteen-year-old enlisted man down in the bowels of a ship saw the war differently than a gunnery officer stationed on an island, while that very same officer saw events differently than a Hellcat fighter pilot who, as a flyer, seemed to exist in another dimension altogether. Though there may be glaring discrepancies among the three accounts, their views can all be totally honest. None are necessarily wrong. They just saw things differently.</p> <p>Certainly every crewman aboard the <i>Franklin</i> has his own personal experience. As you will see, some of their stories illustrate the contrasts in fate along the spectrum of human behavior in times of crisis. Perhaps it seems easy to judge the actions of personnel involved in distant or half-century-old events, but the reader must remember that America and her armed forces were in their third year of a bloody war, the ranks filled with seventeen-and eighteen-year-old kids to augment losses. No written narrative can adequately convey the horrors experienced by these young men who were, in many cases, just a few months out of high school. Therefore I ask the reader&#x2014;and those who served aboard <i>Franklin</i>&#x2014;to show the sailors, marines, and aircrewmen leniency for variations in memories that were forged in fire all those years ago.</p> <p>The hectic nature of combat aboard a huge vessel, especially of the type witnessed during the attack on March 19, 1945, makes it complicated to break down and interconnect individual events, though I attempt to do so where possible. Furthermore, crew movements and firefighting and damage control measures during the disaster are not documented in detail, thus making it more difficult to verify actions taken by specific individuals.</p> <p>Equally difficult are the navy records detailing events of combat actions and daily activities. Due to the kamikaze damage to the <i>Franklin</i> on October 30, 1944, and the fires of March 19, 1945, thousands of pages of action reports detailing combat activity from both periods were lost. In addition, among the losses sustained in the fires were literally thousands of <i>Franklin</i> photographs. Though I wanted to use photos of <i>Franklin</i> at every opportunity, in one instance I used a period photo taken aboard another <i>Essex</i>-class carrier to supplement the losses of those original photos.</p> Lastly, the records I used for reference, particularly those detailing the <i>Franklin</i>&#x2019;s navigation, flight schedules, ordnance information, enemy aircraft encountered, target claims, and times and dates for air group losses are taken directly from the diary of the <i>Franklin</i>. Additionally, facts and specifics of the damage to <i>Franklin</i> are taken directly from after action records, the War Damage Report, Bureau of Ships of the Navy Department. To confirm Japanese ship losses, I used the Joint Army Navy Assessment Committee report of 1947.</p><h2>Heidegger&#39;s Children: Hannah Arendt, Karl Lowith, Hans Jonas, and Herbert Marcuse.</h2><p><p>Martin Heidegger is perhaps the twentieth century's greatest philosopher, and his work stimulated much that is original and compelling in modern thought. A seductive classroom presence, he attracted Germany's brightest young intellects during the 1920s. Many were Jews, who ultimately would have to reconcile their philosophical and, often, personal commitments to Heidegger with his nefarious political views.</p><br><p> In 1933, Heidegger cast his lot with National Socialism. He squelched the careers of Jewish students and denounced fellow professors whom he considered insufficiently radical. For years, he signed letters and opened lectures with ''Heil Hitler!'' He paid dues to the Nazi party until the bitter end. Equally problematic for his former students were his sordid efforts to make existential thought serviceable to Nazi ends and his failure to ever renounce these actions.</p><br><p> This book explores how four of Heidegger's most influential Jewish students came to grips with his Nazi association and how it affected their thinking. Hannah Arendt, who was Heidegger's lover as well as his student, went on to become one of the century's greatest political thinkers. Karl L�with returned to Germany in 1953 and quickly became one of its leading philosophers. Hans Jonas grew famous as Germany's premier philosopher of environmentalism. Herbert Marcuse gained celebrity as a Frankfurt School intellectual and mentor to the New Left.</p><br><p> Why did these brilliant minds fail to see what was in Heidegger's heart and Germany's future? How would they, after the war, reappraise Germany's intellectual traditions? Could they salvage aspects of Heidegger's thought? Would their philosophy reflect or completely reject their early studies? Could these Heideggerians forgive, or even try to understand, the betrayal of the man they so admired? <i>Heidegger's Children</i> locates these paradoxes in the wider cruel irony that European Jews experienced their greatest calamity immediately following their fullest assimilation. And it finds in their responses answers to questions about the nature of existential disillusionment and the juncture between politics and ideas.</p></p><p><p>"Not the least of Martin Heidegger's contributions to twentieth-century thought was his ability to inspire gifted disciples who read him against the grain, producing political theories very different from the ideology endorsed by the master, to his eternal disgrace, in l933. Looking closely at four of the most talented of their number, Richard Wolin, with the provocative directness his readers have come to expect, argues that troubling residues remain not far beneath the surface of their influential work. <i>Heidegger's Children</i> is a book that many will seek to refute, but none can ignore."--<b>Martin Jay, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This is an exceedingly important book that goes right to the core of debates about modernity and the human condition. It is both timely and enduringly important. It is also engrossing--provocative in some places, deeply insightful in others. More than a significant contribution to the field, it constitutes a new field in its own right. Wolin has defined a philosophical Pandora's box, and his interpretation is going to initiate some agonized soul-searching."--<b>Michael Ermarth, Dartmouth College</b></p><b>Richard Wolin</b> is Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York Graduate Center. He is the author of <i>The Politics of Being, The Heidegger Controversy</i>, and <i>The Terms of Cultural Criticism</i>, and he served as academic consultant for the BBC documentary Heidegger: <i>Design for Living</i>. He is a frequent contributor to the <i>New Republic</i> and <i>Dissent</i>.</p><h2>Ernest Holmes: His Life and Times</h2><p>This is a true story although it reads like fiction. The records, kept by a devoted family, provide minute details of an extra�ordinary boy, born the last of nine sons, who grew up in a remote environment in the state of Maine and reached his final triumph across the continent in California where he became the founder of the United Church of Religious Science. The book is filled with lively and amus�ing anecdotes, with recollections of friend�ships and pastimes, of formative years on the lecture platforms, of struggles against adverse odds, of love and marriage and loss, of spiritual conflict and growth and final triumph. But at heart it is the life story of a great soul who blended the natural and the supernatural into one gi�gantic spiritual science and won recogni�tion and honors around the world.</p><p></p><h2>The Living Trust: The Fail-Proof Way to Pass Along Your Estate to Your Heirs Without Lawyers, Courts, or the Probate System</h2><p>The living trust could make the old-fashioned will obsolete. With many complications, taxes, and probate, loved ones could wait up to a year before receiving an estate. But, here is a simple inexpensive way to eliminate those delays by use of a living trust. Completely legal, this book can help the reader work with an attorney to provide for the families&#39; future.</p><p>While not a new concept, the living trust as a form of estate planning is not well known to the general public. Abts joins a chorus of experts recommending this device, which largely replaces a will and avoids passing property through probate. This is a detailed and competent, if somewhat stolid, presentation. Readers may get bogged down in matters such as the tax consequences of holding joint property before they reach anything substantive on living trusts. Robert A. Esperti and Renno L. Peterson's Loving Trust ( LJ 6/15/88) is a better organized and a more engagingly written treatment of this topic. Nevertheless, Abts is somewhat more thorough, and his book can be recommended to libraries where interest is high.<br><i>- Jack Ray, Loyola/Notre Dame Lib., Baltimore</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gazebo</h2><p>Named the primary suspects in the death of a hypochondriac, the victim&#39;s daughter Althea and her fiance+a7 Nicholas request the help of Miss Silver, who finds elusive clues at the site of the murder.

But the real mystery at the heart of Albert Cossery&#x2019;s wry black comedy is not the cause of this death but the paradoxical richness to be found in even the most materially impoverished life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Chief among Cossery&#x2019;s proud beggars is Gohar, a former professor turned whorehouse accountant, hashish aficionado, and street philosopher. Such is his native charm that he has accumulated a small coterie that includes Yeghen, a rhapsodic poet and drug dealer, and El Kordi, an ineffectual clerk and would-be revolutionary who dreams of rescuing a consumptive prostitute. The police investigator Nour El Dine, harboring a dark secret of his own, suspects all three of the murder but finds himself captivated by their warm good humor. How is it that they live amid degrading poverty, yet possess a joie de vivre that even the most assiduous forces of state cannot suppress? Do they, despite their rejection of social norms and all ambition, hold the secret of contentment? And so this short novel, considered one of Cossery&#x2019;s masterpieces, is at once biting social commentary, police procedural, and a mischievous delight in its own right.</p><p>Albert Cossery (1913&#x2013;2008) was a Cairo-born French writer of Lebanese and Greek Orthodox Syrian descent who settled in Paris at the end of the Second World War and lived there for the rest of his life. The son of an illiterate mother and a newspaper-reading father with a private income from inherited property, Cossery was educated from a young age in French schools, where he received his baccalaur�at and developed a love of classical literature. At age seventeen he made a trip to the French capital with the intention of continuing his studies<br>there. Instead he joined the Egyptian merchant marine, eventually serving as chief steward on the Port Said&#x2013;New York line. When he was twenty-seven his first book, <i>Men God Forgot</i>, was published in Cairo and, with the help of Henry Miller, in the United States. In 1945 he returned to Paris to write and live alongside some of the most influential writers and artists of the last century, including Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Tristan Tzara, Alberto Giacometti, Lawrence Durrell, and Jean Genet. He was also, briefly, married to the actress Monique Chaumette. In 1990 Cossery was awarded the Grand Prix de la francophonie de l&#x2019;Acad�mie fran�aise and in 2005 the Grand Prix Poncetton de la Soci�t� des gens de lettres. In recent years several of his books have been newly translated into English, including <i>A Splendid Conspiracy</i>, <i>The Colors of Infamy</i>, and <i>The Jokers</i> (which is available as an NYRB Classic).<br><br>Alyson Waters has translated several works from the French, including two by Albert Cossery. She has received a National Endowment for the Arts Translation Fellowship, a PEN Translation Fund grant, and residency grants from the Centre national du livre, the Villa Gillet in Lyon, France, and the Banff International Literary Translation Centre.

Spencer Chapman survived for years in the jungle as a guerilla fighter. The Jungle is Neutral is his amazing tale of survival and valor against all odds.<br>As he traveled by bicycle, motorcycle, dugout, on foot, or on his belly through the jungle muck, Chapman recruited sympathetic Chinese, Malays, Tamils, and Sakai tribesman into an irregular corps of jungle fighters. Their mission: to harass the Japanese in any way possible. In riveting scenes, Chapman recalls their daring raids as they blew up bridges, cut communication lines, and affixed plasticine to troop-filled trucks idling by the road. They threw grenades and disappeared into the jungle, their faces darkened with carbon, their tommy guns wrapped in tape so as not to reflect the moonlight. When Chapman wasn't battling the Japanese or escaping from their prisons, he found himself fighting the jungle's incessant rain, wild tigers, unfriendly tribesmen, leeches, disease, and malnutrition.<br>This classic tale has been compared to Lawrence of Arabia's classic account, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and the gritty account of day-to-day operations is so accurate that the French Foreign Legion used the book as a primer on jungle warfare. It is a war story without rival.<br>F.

In it, he draws parallels between the development of his subject's artistry and that of American photography during the 60 years he worked, beginning in the 1920s when this country became more conscious of the need to preserve the pristine wilderness. Adams quickly realized the potential power of the lens as an instrument of environmental advocacy, and Wright's essay enables readers to understand the reformatory intent of the photographer's crisp, stern black-and-white images and places him in the context of the mood of the time. Most of the photographs present his view of the American West; six of them study the Navajo as they fit into the Southwestern shadows and light patterns for which he has been long acclaimed.</p><p><i> Margaret Nolan, W.

She describes a childhood deeply affected by her father&#39;s death and her mother&#39;s withdrawal from her life. Raised by her grandparents, Ball craved attention and developed a tempestuous, vivacious, fiery, and yet insecure personality that would later lead her to comic stardom. It took years of working from the bottom of show business before she became a television hit, with the help of her husband, co-star, and business partner, former Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz. Ball abandoned the book for fear of hurting Arnaz, although she gives him credit for the tremendous success she enjoyed with &#34;I Love Lucy.&#34;<b>Lucille Ball </b>(1911&#x2013;1989) was a beloved actress, comedienne, and Hollywood icon.

This definitive English-language work on the savage battle for the Crimea, Where the Iron Crosses Grow sheds new light on this vital aspect of the Eastern Front.</p><p>The Crimea was one of the crucibles of the war on the Eastern Front, where first a Soviet and then a German army were surrounded, fought desperate battles and were eventually destroyed. The fighting in the region was unusual for the Eastern Front in many ways, in that naval supply, amphibious landings and naval evacuation played major roles, while both sides were also conducting ethnic cleansing as part of their strategy - the Germans eliminating the Jews and the Soviets to purging the region of Tartars.</p><p>From 1941, when the first Soviets first created the Sevastopol fortified region, the Crimea was a focal point of the war in the East. German forces under the noted commander Manstein conquered the area in 1941-42, which was followed by two years of brutal colonization and occupation before the Soviet counteroffensive in 1944 destroyed the German 17th Army.</p></p><p>With Russian troops moving in to seize the Crimea in 2014, it would be worth remembering that this is not the first time that Moscow has used force to seize the Crimea. This book is based upon years of research and examines not just the Second World War in the Crimea, but the reasons that the Russians covet the region and have been eager to exclude others from it. <br><br>After reviewing the Russian seizure of the Crimea from the Tatars in the 18th Century, this book focuses on the struggle for the region during the Russian Civil War and the ruthless purges in the region during the 1920s and 1930s. <br><br>The German and Soviet military campaigns in the Crimea are covered in detail, as well as their programs of ethnic cleansing. This book also discusses the continuing role of the Crimea in modern Russian-Ukrainian relations and its potential - as we are now witnessing - as a flashpoint for conflict. Where the Iron Crosses Grow covers a period of history that is virtually unknown to English language readers, but one which has obvious relevance today.Dr. Robert Forczyk has written over 20 books of military history, including Sevastopol 1942.

The planet was rich in valuable ore, and Intergal was determined to mine that ore no matter what the cost. Yanaba Maddock, once a company spy, was adopted by the planet and its people as one of their own. Now her loyalties are to Petaybee, not Intergal, and she is dedicated to keeping Intergal from killing the world she has come to love. But without proof of the planet's sentience, Intergal will proceed with its mining operations. Can Yana find a way to convince Intergal of Petaybee's sentience before it is too late?</p><p>Anne McCaffrey, the Hugo award winning author of the bestselling Dragonriders of Pern novels, is one of science fiction&#39;s most popular authors.

She has co-authored eight other novels with Anne McCaffrey. She lives on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.In the riveting sequel to <i>The Powers That Be</i> , the sentient planet Petaybee becomes an active force in its inhabitants' battle to prevent the ruling Intergal Company's rape of the planet in search of minerals. When a Petaybean delegation tries to inform Intergal's board of directors of the planet's sentience, the group is accused of being under "some sort of massively induced hypnotic illusion," and an official inquiry is set in motion. One of the two investigators, an unsavory and manipulative board member, sets out at once to turn events to his advantage; the other gets to know and works with the people, eventually siding with them. Key players on the Petaybean side are intelligent, mind-speaking felines, who serve as the lines of communication between the isolated human settlements. The main thrust of the story involves the maneuverings of the opposing sides; however, there's a strong, lyrical thread, steeped in Inuit and Celtic lore, that fleshes out the characters, including Petaybee itself, and fills in details of how life has evolved since the planet was first terraformed and stocked with genetically engineered flora and fauna. This is a suspenseful page-turner, well laced with humor, which readers of the first book will welcome. <i>Sally Estes</i></p><h2>Cartridges of the World, 6th Edition</h2><p>The world&#39;s only complete volume on 1,500+ American and European rifle, pistol, and shotgun cartridges-featuring ballistics, cartridge dimensions, loading data, and histories of current and obsolete rounds-now boasts nearly 100 new cartridge listings!

He looks at the impact of modern life on bees and beekeeping, and the changes and challenges every beekeeper faces in light of varroa mites and African bees. He suggest that for many beekeepers, the option of wintering nucleus colonies provides a source of fresh bees, locally acclimatized queens, replacement hives, colonies for operational growth, and colonies for sale. Drawing on the concepts of Langstroth, Doolittle and Brother Adam (Buckfast Abbey), Connor distills his unique academic and commercial beekeeping experiences -- working with bees, beekeeping, queen rearing, colony managment and pollination -- and creates a concise and thought-provoking work.</p><p>Michigan native Lawrence (Larry) Connor departed Michigan State University upon completion of his Ph.D. dissertation on strawberry pollination when he assumed the position of extension apicultural entomologist at The Ohio State University (Columbus).

Increase Essentials includes both a cook-book approach to setting up nucs and handling new colonies but additionally includes easy-to-understand bee biology basics of establishing new colonies. If you already know how to make up nucs that consistently yield productive units then you do not need this book.

Most of all they keep watching <i>American Idol</i>. How did Simon Cowell snooker himself into a huge payday? Stay tuned . . .<br><br>In<i> Desperate Networks </i>Bill Carter digs deep inside the industry, delivering utterly irresistible &#x201c;dish&#x201d; that you won&#x2019;t find anywhere else. It&#x2019;s the perfect book to read when there&#x2019;s nothing on TV.</p><p><p>Bill Carter reports on the television industry for the <i>New York Times</i> and has written about television for almost 30 years. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and a native of Brooklyn, New York, he currently resides in New Jersey with his wife and children.</p>Chapter One<br>"Beautiful Girls"<br><br>On a sunny Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan in mid-May 2005, few people in the great city had reason to be as buoyant, as self-satisfied, as downright gleeful as the reserved, handsome, impeccably dressed fifty-four-year-old man sitting in a prominent aisle seat in the orchestra section of Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center. <br><br>For Robert A. Iger, this was a day of real triumph, not merely because ABC, the network he had been associated with for virtually his entire career, all the way back to 1977, had emerged from a seemingly endless dark night of failure and financial loss to sudden, spectacular success, but also because he had survived one of the most precarious apprenticeships in media history. He had finally been designated as the successor to Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company. <br><br>That appointment had come just two months earlier, and it was due in no small measure to the startling turnaround at ABC during the just-completed 2004&#x2014;2005 television season. Iger, once the top programmer at ABC himself, had presided, in his capacity as the number-two Disney executive, over nearly ten years of flops. The network seemed to be allergic to hit television shows. A batch of the biggest hits in recent years&#x2013;<i>Survivor, CSI, American Idol, The Apprentice&#x2013;</i>had all turned up first at ABC, only to have the net�work recoil in rejection. <i><br></i>Much of the blame for those mind-blowing misreads had been laid at the feet of Iger and Eisner, in constant stories of how their crippling control over the network&#x2019;s decision making had under�mined the efforts of the network&#x2019;s creative executives to find the shows ABC needed so badly. Iger dismissed the stories as inaccu�rate, but certainly they had some effect on his increasingly chal�lenged aspirations to succeed Eisner. If he could not fix ABC in years of trying, why would anyone think he could master the more complex issues facing the Disney Company? <br><br>Nor had the 2004 season begun with any great expectations. Just one year earlier, in April, there had been yet another multi-executive pile-up at ABC, as Iger axed both of the managers running the entertainment division and installed a new boss less than a month before the upfront. Nobody ever did something like that in April, because the upfront, an annual sales presentation of the new selec�tions of network prime-time shows, was so important to every net-work&#x2019;s bottom line. <br><br>At the upfront, so called because clients purchased commercial time in network shows <i>before </i>the season commenced, the big adver�tising clients in New York piled into some elegant midtown hall, watched as the network trotted out clips of the new series it had picked up, and then attended a loud, crowded, lavish after-party where many of the young ad buyers lined up at booths to get their photos taken with&#x2013;and autographed by&#x2013;the new &#x201c;stars.&#x201d; For ABC in recent years, that had meant more Ernie Hudson than Tim Allen. Even when ABC did seem to build a successful show with a real star, like the comedy <i>8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daugh�ter, </i>something awful seemed to happen, like the shocking sudden death of that show&#x2019;s star, John Ritter. ABC had the feel&#x2013;and maybe the smell&#x2013;of the chronically snakebitten. <br><br>Iger&#x2019;s appointment of Stephen McPherson that April, accompa�nied by the announcement that he would create a new, improved ABC schedule from the pieces left behind by people who had just been ashcanned, seemed like an engraved invitation to every rattler, cobra, and asp in Hollywood to come and dine again on the carcass of ABC. <br><br>This time the snakes went hungry. Now, a year later, no one in Lincoln Center, with the possible exception of McPherson himself, had benefited more from what ABC had wrought in the preceding twelve months than Bob Iger. <br><br>As the upfront presentation began, the trim, ruddy-faced McPher�son walked out on stage, exuding a stony confidence. Thanks to the turnaround, McPherson had amassed, as a top Hollywood agent, Rick Rosen of Endeavor, put it, &#x201c;more political capital than anyone else in this business.&#x201d; <br><br>McPherson had several people to thank for that success&#x2013; including Iger, of course, for putting him in the job&#x2013;but surely no one more than the man waiting behind a decorated screen at the center of the stage. <br>Behind that screen, the man who had turned television on its head waited, psyching himself up for the performance of his lifetime. <br><br>Marc Cherry could not help thinking of the significance of the moment, about how far he had come&#x2013;all the way from forgotten, ignored, and broke to the toast of network television. Decked out in white tie and tails, Cherry was to be the centerpiece of this day of celebration for ABC. <br><br>ABC was so downtrodden a year earlier that its late-night star, Jimmy Kimmel, had brought down the house with a joke about how each of the networks could be identified as a familiar type from high school. ABC was &#x201c;the fat kid who eats paste&#x201d;&#x2013;that same ABC now had what the advertisers craved: the hottest of the hot shows. <br><br>Out on stage, McPherson was working quickly through his early material to get to his major announcement: &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend Marc Cherry!&#x201d; <br><br>The screen parted in the middle and Cherry walked out with a flair that both reveled in and defied his own self-described &#x201c;Stubby Kaye&#x201d; look: round-faced, balding, roly-poly. The white tie and tails got a few laughs. Well, why shouldn&#x2019;t this be a grand moment for this guy, the writer who could not get an interview, never mind a job, and who now had created <i>Desperate Housewives, </i>the biggest new scripted television show in years? <br><br>Cherry played it up. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know about you guys, but I had the nicest year,&#x201d; he said, soaking in the laughter. He called it an amazing time for his cast, his studio, and &#x201c;especially my network.&#x201d; <br><br>Then he turned to an unseen orchestra leader. &#x201c;Hit it!&#x201d; he com�manded, turning his shoulder to the back of the stage as music came up and a montage of shots from the first season of <i>Desperate Housewives </i>played on video screens above him. <br><br>A couple of other guys in tuxes appeared, handing Cherry a top hat and cane. With complete aplomb, he began to belt out &#x201c;Beauti�ful Girls,&#x201d; the Sondheim song from <i>Follies, </i>in a tenor voice so pure and powerful that many in the audience looked immediately for signs of lip-synching&#x2013;but saw only a trained musical-theater singer fully in his element. <br><br>Cherry sang: <br><i>&#x201c;Hats off, here they come, those beautiful girls . . . That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ve been waiting for.&#x201d; </i><br>Cherry&#x2019;s face loomed huge on the video screens as the camera caught him in close-up. <br><i>&#x201c;See them in their glory&#x2013;<br>Diamonds and pearls, dazzling jewels by the score. . . .&#x201d;</i><br>Iger, beaming in his tightly controlled way, had to remember how Cherry had called to congratulate him the day the Disney appoint�ment was announced. Bob, surely recognizing what <i>Desperate Housewives </i>had meant to the moribund network that had been undermining his career ambitions, told Cherry, &#x201c;Well, thank you for your part in it.&#x201d; <br><br>As Cherry sang, a full chorus line of guys with top hats and canes filed out and joined him. <br><i>&#x201c;This is what beauty can be.<br>Beauty celestial, the best you&#x2019;ll agree . . . <br>All for you, these beautiful girls!&#x201d;<br></i><br><br>And with another flourish Cherry swept his arm back and said, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, straight from Wisteria Lane, the Desperate Housewives!&#x201d; <br><br>Now the chorus escorted out a lineup of truly beautiful girls&#x2013; women really, a group of six actresses, mostly in their forties, who had captured the country&#x2019;s imagination from their first week on the air eight months earlier. Out they walked in floor-length gowns and faux jewels, a couple waving snow-white boas: Marcia Cross, the show&#x2019;s uptight Bree, in a coppery-gold gown with a cleavage-baring cutout; Eva Longoria, the Hispanic sexpot, Gabrielle, in a bejeweled strapless silver number, her long diamond string earrings stretching so far one literally rested in her cleavage. <br><br>The fourth in the parade was without boa or jewels, but the flash�ing smile and elegantly curled brown tresses signaled the central star�dom of Teri Hatcher, the emotionally vulnerable Susan of the series, in a striking beaded white V-neck gown. The reception from the audi�ence reinforced the point: Hatcher, the lead in an earlier, now almost forgotten ABC series, <i>Lois &amp; Clark, </i>was a megawatt star again after descending so far into has-been land that she found herself, only a few months before her <i>Housewives </i>audition, far more desperate in her real life than anything Marc Cherry&#x2019;s scripts had dished up for her. <br><i>&#x201c;This is what drives men insane,<br>Here from our cheery, Wisteria Lane . . .&#x201d;<br></i><br>One day earlier, Monday, at a venue famed for the art of high-kicking, Radio City Music Hall, Jeff Zucker, NBC&#x2019;s increasingly embattled entertainment leader, had been forced to put on a dance of his own. NBC, the network that had dominated ratings and prof�its over much of the previous two decades, had accomplished a fall of Icarus-like proportions, crashing all the way from first place to fourth (and dead last) in the span of one September-to-May televi�sion season. And the only credible message Zucker could deliver that day was along the lines of: Yeah, we blew it. <br><br>That afternoon, NBC hoped to package its programs skillfully enough to convince advertisers that the network&#x2019;s aging series and new unknowns were still worth near the same level of investment as the year before.

Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</h2><p>This first-ever hardcover retrospective of the legendary underground artist&#39;s work features his characters Keep on Truckin&#39;, Fritz the Cat, Devil Girl, and Mr. Natural, as well as unpublished rarities and personal reflections from the artist himself. Original.</p><p>Robert Crumb, world-famous illustrator and definite pervert, got his start in the underground comics scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. <i>The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> is a collection of his best work from the last 50 years (it's got kids stuff, too, which is pretty fascinating). The volume is a welcome reminder that, screwed up as Crumb may be, he's also a tremendously talented, utterly original artist. He artistically embodies a certain segment of the '60s, and as that fades even further into history, Crumb's material becomes more important. Is <i>The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> funny? Yes, certainly, in a coarse, Rabelaisian way; you'll either find it a hoot, or horribly racist and sexist. And it's not for the kiddies, obviously. But R. Crumb is so well known by now, that you probably know which group you fall into, the lovers or the haters. The lovers will find this book a wonderful treat.Robert Crumb was born in 1943 in Philadelphia. After a period drawing greeting cards, he began to work with MAD creator Harvey Kurtzman on his new humor magazine, Help! After Help! folded, Crumb heard the siren song of the Summer of Love and moved to San Francisco in 1967. He began drawing LSD-influenced comics for various underground newspapers, including The East Village Other and Yarrowstalks. In 1968, the first issue of Zap Comix was published and Crumb hawked copies from a baby carriage in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Zap Comix was a success and attracted the attention of other artists, including S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, and Rick Griffin, all of whom joined Zap with issue 2. Crumb&#39;s comics mixed a nostalgia for comics&#39; rich history with a psychedelic exuberance. Crumb produced many more comics in the late sixties and early seventies, including Despair, Motor City, Big Ass Comics, Home Grown Funnies, People&#39;s Comix, and Your Hytone Comics, as well as the books Head Comix and Fritz the Cat. Pursued by hustling businessmen who wanted to merchandise his characters Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, Crumb retreated to rural California. In 1981, Crumb started Weirdo, a new anthology magazine featuring his own new work, the comics of a new generation of young cartoonists, and intriguingly strange work by certifiable &#34;outsider&#34; cartoonists. At the same time, Crumb drew several issues of a new solo comic book, Hup. In 1995, Crumb was the subject of an award-winning film biography, Crumb. Recent books and comics include Kafka, Waiting for Food, and Self-Loathing. Crumb lives in France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, and their daughter.</p><h2>An Open Book: Chapters fom a Reader&#39;s Life</h2><p><p><strong>"A love story, full of a passion for literature and marked by intellectual vigor."&#x2015;Bernadette Murphy, <em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong></p> "All that kid wants to do is stick his nose in a book," Michael Dirda's steelworker father used to complain, worried about his son's passion for reading. In <em>An Open Book</em>, one of the most delightful memoirs to emerge in years, the acclaimed literary journalist Michael Dirda re-creates his boyhood in rust-belt Ohio, first in the working-class town of Lorain, then at Oberlin College. In addition to his colorful family and friends, <em>An Open Book</em> also features the great writers and fictional characters who fueled Dirda's imagination: from Green Lantern to Sherlock Holmes, from Candy to Proust. The result is an affectionate homage to small-town America&#x2015;summer jobs, school fights, sweepstakes contests, and first dates&#x2015;as well as a paean to what could arguably be called the last great age of reading. "Dirda is a superb literary essayist."&#x2015;Harold Bloom "Michael Dirda's memoir&#x2015;no surprise to me&#x2015;is so good that I went up to the attic meaning to send him one of my antique Big Little books as a salute to excellence...A great job. I'll be buying <em>An Open Book</em> for my children and grandchildren."&#x2015;Russell Baker, author of <em>Growing Up</em> "Here, in <em>An Open Book</em>, is the show and tell of a wonderful American story, everything coming together in the immemorial dance of literature and memory, of history and gossip, and of the deeply felt, bittersweet story (his own) of a young life. Read it and rejoice."&#x2015;George Garrett "A lovely, unapologetically nostalgic remembrance of growing up in a more innocent America, but it is also the touching story of one person's lifelong love affair with words."&#x2015;June Sawyer, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> "Dirda inhabits each book he reads. Inhabits it&#x2015;and makes a space alongside it for us to join him....He is a rare treasure."&#x2015;James Sallis, <em>Boston Sunday Globe</em></p><p>Michael Dirda, who won a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism at the&nbsp;Washington Post Book World, is the author of&nbsp;An Open Book,&nbsp;Bound to Please, and&nbsp;Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.&#34;Dirda inhabits each book he reads. Inhabits it--and makes a space alongside it for us to join him. . . .

A trained warrior, blessed with the gifts of prophecy and song, he grew to manhood in a land ravaged by the brutal greed of petty chieftains and barbarian invaders.Merlin: Respected, feared and hated by many, he was to have a higher destiny. for It was he who prepared the way for the momentous event that would unite the Island of the Might the coming of Arthur Pendragon, Lord of the Kingdom of Summer.</p><p>An enchanting tale of love and loss, glory and grandeur, set in the twilight of Rome&#39;s power . . . where the Celtic chieftains of Britain battle to save their land from an onrushing darkness . . . In this modern classic, Stephen Lawhead presents a majestic retelling of Western literature&#39;s most compelling epic. Merlin. His golden eyes saw the shape of a world yet to be. His wisdom would light the path of the coming King. Born of a union between druid and faery, he was trained as a bard and schooled in the ways of battle. But his heart and calling were greater than a warrior&#39;s. Son of the great Taliesin, the song of his father coursed through his soul. Yet his life and mission were to be his own. And though sovereignty was his, he would lay it aside to serve a king of his own choosing. As his powers transcended those of mortal men, so, too, would his trials, his griefs . . . and the dark might of his most fearsome enemy. In the twilight of Tome&#39;s rule over the Island of the Mighty, as smaller men vied for ascendancy, his would be the hand to lay the foundations of a new order -- the Kingdom of Summer . . . and Arthur, Pendragon of Britain. Merlin is book two in the Pendragon Cycle.<p><strong>Stephen R. Lawhead</strong> is an internationally acclaimed author of mythic history and imaginative fiction. He is the author of such epics as the King Raven, Song of Albion, and Dragon King trilogies. Although born and raised in America, he was brought to England by his research into Celtic legend and lore and now resides in Oxford with his wife, writer Alice Slaikeu Lawhead.</p></p><h2>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Worlds of Deep Space Nine #2: Trill and Bajor (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - World of Deep Space Nine)</h2><p>Upheaval threatens to destroy the civilization on Trill as Ezri Dax must uncover millennia of lies and deceptions to uncover the truth about the planet&#39;s origins, while on the planet Bajor, conflicting visions of Bajor&#39;s role in the Federation divide the planet&#39;s inhabitants, in the second of a three-volume series examining six alien civilizations.

Love, including an old woman's for her cats and a boy's for his embattled father, exerts its spell in all twelve; the title derives from a story in which an American banjo virtuoso demonstrates his licks to an enthralled Soviet audience in the heart of the Cold War, while being hounded by the epistolary aftermath of a one-night stand in Washington, D.C.<br><br>To these tales Mr. Updike has added a novella-length sequel to his quartet of novels about Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom. Several old strands come at last together, and the dead man's survivors fitfully entertain his memory while pursuing their own happiness over the edge of the millennium. The place is, as before, the area of Brewer, Pennsylvania; the time, the last months of 1999.</p><p>If John Updike had never published anything but short stories--if the novels, essays, verse, and reams of occasional prose vanished into thin air--he would still be a presence to reckon with in American letters. Having said that, it's only fair to point out that his 13th collection, <i>Licks of Love</i>, is one of the master's patchier efforts. He has lost none of his notorious fluency, and even the duds are enlivened by lovely stabs of perception. But in several tales ("The Women Who Got Away," "New York Girl," "Natural Color"), Updike seems perversely bent on proving his detractors right, serving up familiar narratives of adultery and '60s-era swinging. There's no reason why lust and rage <i>shouldn't</i> dance attendance on this randy genius's old age. But he's already written about the art of extracurricular canoodling at such length that these entries are bound to seem like retreads.<p> That's the bad news. The good news is that the rest of the collection is a sheer delight. "My Father on the Verge of Disgrace" explores some fascinating Oedipal outskirts, even as the narrator's first cigarette takes on a theological accent: "It was my way of becoming a human being, and part of being human is being on the verge of disgrace." In "How Was It, Really?" Updike unveils the <i>real</i> dirty secret of old age, which is not the persistence of erotic appetite but the inevitable, appalling failure of memory. Best of all, he returns to two of his longest-running franchises, with admirable results in both cases. "His Oeuvre" revives that Semitic doppelg�nger Henry Bech for one more lap around the track, and finds the author making intermittent fun of his own fancy prose style. Harry Angstrom is, needless to say, beyond hope of resurrection. But in a 182-page novella, "Rabbit Remembered," Updike brings back his survivors for a superb, surprising curtain call. The author's present-tense notation of American life (whose paradoxical epicenter is, as always, Brewer, Pennsylvania) remains as mesmerizing as ever. And despite his death, the putative hero is everywhere, as his illegitimate daughter returns to the unwilling bosom of the Angstrom clan: "A whiff of Harry, a pale glow, an unsettling drift comes off this girl, this thirty-nine-year-old piece of evidence." Wallowing in this unexpected bonus, Updike fans should steel themselves for a single pang of regret: this is likely to be the last Rabbit he will pull from his hat. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Obadiah the Bold</h2><p>A young boy&#39;s desire to be a pirate is quelled by his brothers and sisters during a game.</p><p>Brinton Turkle was born on August 15, in Alliance, Ohio.

Try to change things, or accept that the future is unchangeable and make the best of it? In <i>Flashforward</i>, Nobel-hungry physicists conducting an unimaginably high-energy experiment accidentally induce a global consciousness shift. In an instant, everyone on Earth is "flashed forward" 21 years, experiencing several minutes of the future. But while everyone is, literally, out of their minds, their bodies drop unconscious; when the world reawakens, car wrecks, botched surgeries, falls, and other mishaps add up to massive death and destruction.<p> Slowly, as recovery efforts continue, people realize that during the Flashforward (as it comes to be called) they experienced a vision of the future. The range of visions is astounding--those who would be asleep in the future saw psychedelic dream landscapes, while others saw nothing at all (presumably they'd be dead). But those who saw everyday life 20 years hence have to come to grips with evidence of dreams forsaken (or realized). Soon, the physicists who caused the Flashforward are struggling to help the world decide whether the future is changeable--and whether the experiment is worth repeating. Robert J. Sawyer has captured a truly compelling idea with <i>Flashforward</i>, and he fully explores what such an event might mean to humanity. Fans will find this to be his best work to date, although the ending seems rushed after a detailed buildup. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"[Robert J.

A grook is a short, aphoristic poem, accompanied by an appropriate drawing, revealing in a minimum of words and with a minimum of lines some basic truth about the human condition. Grooks were created originally during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. They began life as a sort of underground language just out of reach of the understanding of the Germans. They have since become one of the most widely read forms of composition in the Scandinavian - and English - languages. Grooks are the product of one of the most ingenious minds of this or any other century. A Danish scientist turned poet, Piet Hein has published longer poems, fiction, drama and essays; he has designed a &#39;rectangular oval&#39;, the Super-Ellipse, used in the new Stockholm city center and other cities; he has invented games, the newest of which, SOMA and the Super-Egg, have just been released by Parker Brothers to the delight of hundreds of thousands. What in the world is a grook? Look inside and see for yourself; but beware: you are about to become a grookaddict, a happy victim of one of the most relaxing pleasures available in this nervous world....&#34; The first Grooks book was originally published in the US by M.I.T. Press in 1966.</p><p></p><h2>Hardball (A V.I. Warshawski Novel)</h2><p><b>Chicago politics&#x2014;past, present, and future&#x2014;take center stage in this complex and compelling V.I.

Koehler methodically reviews the Stasi's activities within East Germany and overseas, including its programs for internal repression, international espionage, terrorism and terrorist training, art theft, and special operations in Latin America and Africa.Koehler was both Berlin bureau chief of the Associated Press during the height of the Cold War and a U.S. Army Intelligence officer. His insider's account is based on primary sources, such as U.S. intelligence files, Stasi documents made available only to the author, and extensive interviews with victims of political oppression, former Stasi officers, and West German government officials. Drawing from these sources, Koehler recounts tales that rival the most outlandish Hollywood spy thriller and, at the same time, offers the definitive contribution to our understanding of this still largely unwritten aspect of the history of the Cold War and modern Germany.</p><p><b>John O.

Now, in the <i> The Mr. Food Cookbook,</i> he provides 250 of the most requested quick, easy, scrumptious recipes and ideas from his national show. These dishes look and taste gourmet without the gourmet work, and the best part is they can be made from inexpensive ingredients right off the supermarket shelf. <i> The Mr. Food Cookbook</i> solves the ever-present problem of what to make for dinner and how to make it fast! From weekday dinners to entertaining menus, this book shows you how and you'll agree with Mr. Food when he exclaims, <b>Ooh it's so Good!!</b></p></p><p>Art Ginsburg has been appearing as Mr. Food for more than fifteen years, and his show is the largest food news insert in the nation, seen in more than four hundred cities. He has sold almost two million of his Mr. Food cookbooks. A native of Troy, New York, he now resides in South Florida, where he produces his syndicated television show.Known to television audiences through his commercially sponsored "Mr. Food" food news inserts, Ginsburg (who has seen fit to trademark the phrase "OOH, it's so GOOD!!") has been demonstrating the art of quick cookery for more than 10 years. Only now, however, does he compile his most frequently requested recipes; this book is meant to answer such questions as "What can I make that's gourmet looking or tasting but not gourmet difficult?" Although the author's version of cuisine rapide affirms current food trends with recipes for the ubiquitous pesto sauce and an original, simple-to-prepare hot artichoke spread, the vast majority are steeped in anything-but-gourmet 1950s sensibilities. Many recipes rely on the sorts of "Ugly American" convenience foods (frozen whipped topping, instant potato flakes) that cooks have long since banished from their cupboards. Further, the microwave oven, today's most important convenience tool, is relegated, when mentioned, to defrosting frozen ingredients. To his credit, Ginsberg offers some inventive recipes suited to meat-and-potatoes tastes; the best (turkey lasagne, grilled meat loaf) call for ingredients of quality. Yet beginning cooks, the volume's obvious targets, may be befuddled by occasionally skimpy or illogical preparation methods.

As Jeremy navigates life with his parents, girlfriend Sara, and buddies Pierce and Hector, he embodies all the characteristics unique to the weirdest, toughest, and most intense time most guys ever face: the teen years.

The scarcity of documentary evidence on the one hand and the enormous scale of his artistic achievement on the other have left us at once dazzled and bereft. Now, after more than twenty years of work, Simon Schama has managed to combine an absolute mastery of the painter&#39;s life and times with an unprecedented sympathy for Rembrandt&#39;s character as it found both expression and transformation in his art. The result is enthralling as biography and as history, but above all it amounts to the first reconstruction of Rembrandt&#39;s genius that does full justice to its subject.</p><p>The great 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn left us so many arresting self-portraits, painted at every stage in his eventful life, that his distinctive face and bearing are a familiar part of the 20th-century cultural landscape, a recognizable presence in galleries across Europe and North America. Nonetheless, the artist himself remains an enigma. Rembrandt was a notoriously difficult man and an inveterate risk taker in life and art: his aspirations to a grandiose Amsterdam lifestyle in the heyday of his popularity as a painter of portraits and large-scale historical works bankrupted him, and he died in relative poverty. His personal effects and treasured collection of paintings and natural rarities were sold off and dispersed, leaving the historian with a tantalizingly scant body of fragmentary records around which to build a convincing biography. <p> In <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i>, Simon Schama--the leading historical craftsman of our era, with a career-long commitment to Dutch history--succeeds with consummate skill in bringing the heroic painter of such masterpieces as <i>The Night Watch</i> and <i>Portrait of Jan Six</i> vividly to life. Returning to the bustling Dutch world with which he first made his reputation in the bestselling <i>Embarrassment of Riches</i> (1987), Schama re-creates Rembrandt's life and times with all the verve and panache of a historical novelist--while never for an instant losing his scrupulous grip on recorded fact and detail. The telling surviving fragments of archival information about Rembrandt's personal and professional history are skillfully embedded in a rich, dense tapestry of the commercial whirl and political hurly-burly of the 17th-century Low Countries--a divided territory, split between the Catholic and Protestant faiths and the contested powers of the Spanish Hapsburgs and the Dutch Republic--with the tentacles of the tale reaching into the most unexpected shadowy corners of European love and war, aspiration and intrigue.</p><p> <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i> is, in fact, two biographies for the price of one. From the outset, Schama contrasts the life of Rembrandt with that of his older, equally talented countryman Peter Paul Rubens, whose meteoric rise and sustained success as a society painter forms a revealing contrast with Rembrandt's unhappier relationship with fame and fortune. The comparison is a telling one. Where Rubens furnishes the wealthy and powerful with glorious reflections of, and visual foils for, their social and political aspirations and glory, Rembrandt can never resist testing the envelope of taste and stylistic acceptability. His challenge to his clients to embrace the shock of his painterly experiments with technique, texture, and composition ultimately produced his downfall. The Amsterdam town council took down his <i>The Oath-swearing of Claudius Civilis</i>, rolled it up, and returned his masterpiece to him to be cut down in an attempt to sell it to a suitable buyer.</p><p> This is a gorgeous book to own, too. <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i> is printed on heavy, high-gloss paper and lavishly illustrated throughout in full color. The double-page color spreads of the most memorable of Rembrandt's works will take readers' breath away. But above all, this is narrative history at its very best, a page-turner and an adventure story that will make the reader laugh and cry by turns in the time-honored tradition of masterly writing. <i>--Lisa Jardine</i></p>t as for Shakespeare, all the world was indeed a stage, and he knew in exhaustive detail the tactics of its performance: the strutting and mincing; the wardrobe and the face paint; the full repertoire of gesture and grimace; the flutter of hands and the roll of the eyes; the belly laugh and the half-stifled sob. He knew what it looked like to seduce, to intimidate, to wheedle, and to console; to strike a pose or preach a sermon; to shake a fist or uncover a breast; how to sin and how to atone; how to commit murder and how to commit suicide. No artist had ever been so fascinated by the fashioning of personae, beginning with his own. No painter ever looked with such unsparing intelligence or such bottomless compassion at our entrances and our exits and the whole rowdy show in between.<br><br>More than three centuries after his death, Rembrandt remains the most deeply loved of all the great masters of painting, his face so familiar to us from the self-portraits painted at every stage in his life, y</p><h2>Wolf Lake: A Novel</h2><p>Could a nightmare be used as a murder weapon?

Your vision of a Japanese garden need not be confined to Japan. Here is a fully comprehensive guiide which will enable you to capture in your home or office environment the elusive spirit of the Japanese garden-no matter where you live. <br><br>The author, a Japanese landscape architect who has been living and designing Japanese gardens in the West for many years, will show you step by-step how to accomplish this ideal utilizing your own special environment and using materials which are readily available in the West. Since moving to the UK in 1974, the author has designed and created many Japanese gardens, from small private gardens to large public spaces of over two acres. It is from this direct experience that he draws the material for this book. The step-by-step instructions are easy-to-follow, and also included are many drawings and photographs to illustrate the points that are made. <br><br>"Many books on Japanese gardens can be found in bookstores and libraries, but most do not take into account the different environments found outside Japan nor the diverse materials available worldwide. They tend either to be translations of books written by Japanese landscape architects and gardeners living and working in Japan, or books written by those who visit Japan to research the gardens, with the intention of introducing them to the rest of the world... These books are ideal for learning about the history and appearance of Japanese gardens, but lack the practical advice necessary for constructing your own garden.. .I believe that as the interest in and understanding of Japanese culture continues to spread, so will the popularity of and desire for Japanese gardens. I hope that this book will give pleasure to all those of you who, like me, are captivated by the gardens of Japan, and that it will help you to create a garden of your own that you can enjoy day after day."</p><p><br>TAKASHI SAWANO was born in Shizuoka, Japan in 1948.

After traveling throughout the USA and Europe, he finally settled in England where he has lived for the past 25 years. He is the United Kingdom's foremost designer of Japanese gardens and his work can be seen in private homes, commercial developments and public parks.

T. Barnum, Written by Himself</h2><p>An autobiography of Phineas T Barnum that immortalizes the showman who hoodwinked customers into paying to hear the reminiscences of a woman presented as George Washington&#39;s 161-year-old nurse, the impresario who brought Jenny Lind to America and toured Europe with General Tom Thumb, and the grand entrepreneur of the American Museum of New York.</p><p>For more than fifty years, Phineas T. Barnum embodied all that was grand and fraudulent in American mass culture. Over the course of a life that spanned the nineteenth century (1810-91), he inflicted himself upon a surprisingly willing public in a variety of guises, from newspaper editor (or libeler) to traveling showman (or charlatan) and distinguished public benefactor (or shameless hypocrite).<p>Barnum deliberately cultivated his ambiguous public image through a lifelong advertising campaign, shrewdly exploiting the cultural and technological capabilities of the new publishing industry. While running his numerous shows and exhibitions, Barnum managed to publish newspaper articles, exposes of fraud (not his own), self-help tracts, and a series of best-selling autobiographies, each promising to give "the true history of my many adventures".</p><p>Updated editions of The Life of P. T. Barnum appeared regularly, allowing Barnum to keep up with demand and prune the narrative of details that might offend posterity. The present volume is the first modern edition of Barnum's original and outrageous autobiography, published in 1855 and unavailable for more than a century. Brazen, confessional, and immensely entertaining, it immortalizes the showman who hoodwinked customers into paying to hear the reminiscences of Joyce Heth, ostensibly George Wash-ington's 161-year-old nurse. It also unveils the grand entrepreneur of the American Museum of New York and the impresario who brought Jenny Lind to America and toured Europe with General Tom Thumb. Above all, it ensures that Barnum would be properly remembered ... exactly as he created himself.</p>Whalen is an associate professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><h2>Wonderful Name Of Jesus</h2><p>Clearly explains, using many biblical references, the authority in the the Name of Jesus &#x2013; something the church dearly needs to start using more and more often when confronting sickness and demonic activity.

Reprint.</p><p>Like Cynthia Sasse and Peggy Widder's The Kirtland Massacre ( LJ 10/1/91), Earley's Prophet of Death recounts the 1989 Morman cult murders of the Avery family. Both books are well researched, but Earley's focuses much more on the dynamics of the group. He also provides greater details on cult leader Jeff Lundgren's growing psychosis. At 320 pages, the book seems too long, and some points are covered in too much detail. Still, this may be the better book for a psychological profile of a killer and the cult who assisted in the murders of five people. Perhaps as interesting as how the group came together is the disintegration that followed when the individuals realized they were facing murder charges. Their faith in Lundgren only seemed as strong as his ability to protect them; they squealed loudly at the trials.

For those murders Gilmore was sent to languish on Death Row - and could confidently expect his sentence to be commuted to life imprisonment. In America, no one had been executed for ten years. But Gary Gilmore wanted to die, and his ensuing battle with the authorities for the right to do so made him into a world-wide celebrity - and ensured that his execution turned into the most gruesome media event of the decade.</p><p><i>The Executioner's Song</i> is a work of unprecedented force. It is the true story of Gary Gilmore, who in 1977 became the first person executed in the United States since the reinstitution of the death penalty. Gilmore, a violent yet articulate man who chose not to fight his death-penalty sentence, touched off a national debate about capital punishment. He allowed Norman Mailer and researcher Lawrence Schiller complete access to his story. Mailer took the material and produced an immense book with a dry, unwavering voice and meticulous attention to detail on Gilmore's life--particularly his relationship with Nicole Baker, whom Gilmore claims to have killed. What unfolds is a powerful drama, a distorted love affair, and a chilling look into the mind of a murderer in his countdown with a firing squad.<b>Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize</b><br><br>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. <b>The<br>Executioner's Song</b> is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence.

And nobody in the world knows big tuskers better than Tony Sanchez-Ari�o. This book lists every known elephant with at least one tusk of 130 pounds or more and tells the stories of who hunted them, who owns them, or how they were found. It is based upon three years of research, utilizing information unearthed from the archives of countless libraries, museums, professional hunting organizations, and private collections. Amazingly, Sanchez-Ari�o uncovered dozens of elephants not listed in Rowland Ward, some on public display, some hidden in private collections, and all of them massive. The stories are all here, often in great detail, accompanied by photos. For example, who actually shot the huge elephant entered twice in Rowland Ward with slightly different measurements that was shot in the same place and in the same year? Did you know it was an American adventurer in the C.A.R who shot what is likely one of the ten biggest bulls ever recorded? This happened in the early 1890s and it was never entered in any record book. Many of the stories Sanchez-Ari�o found involve hunters who did not want to follow a track because it was too small-but when they did, they discovered small feet do not always indicate small tusks. Many of these elephants were so famous that they had names given to them by the locals, which added to their legendary status and lore. Tony Sanchez-Ari�o and his research team followed up every "elephant track," whether small or large, and recorded every elephant they could find that had at least one tusk over 130 pounds. Huge tuskers like these are now a thing of the past, but they march through the pages of this book in all their glory, brought back to life through entertaining text and stunning images.</p><p></p><h2>Troubled Waters (Merovingen Nights, No 3) (Merovingen Nights, 3)</h2><p>Set in the land of Merovingen, this science fiction adventure features religious fanatics, kidnap victims, and angry mobs bent on revenge</p><p><strong>C.

These are works our parents and grandparents may have read, and although such things as Postal Zones and the War Department have changed, the author's imaginative plots, settings, and characters are delightful. In these three works we find such things as: Martians (who are about only three feet tall), learning to play baseball and becoming a pitcher's worst nightmare, rabbits and skunks parachuting from a plane (piloted by Freddy) using umbrellas, skunks fighting with quarterstaffs, and Freddy fending off foreign agents trying to steal flying saucer plans.

Refreshingly fun and imaginative, these works are made especially so by McDonough's narrative skill.

Somehow, Christians have lost ground in every cultural area of leadership and influence in Europe and America since 1700. This is an indubitable fact. The remaining Christians search for an explanation. They want to know how it happened. This is the story of the decline and fall of Western civilization. It is the story of uncommonly powerful men, unfathomably evil men&amp; apostates. Reader beware! This book faces head-on the spiritual forces that leveled a full-out attack on the Christian faith in the Western world. On the one hand, it is a story of demonic possession, insanity, suicide, mass-murder, adultery, homosexuality, cultural and social revolutions, and unbridled, maniacal apostasy. It is the story of apostasy on a massive scale. But it is also a story of hope and victory for the last men standing in the ashes of Western civilization. It will be a testimony to the inevitable triumph of Jesus Christ over the great men of renown who picked the wrong fight in the history of the West.</p></p><p><p>Homeschooled himself in the 1960s and 70s, <b>Kevin Swanson</b> and his wife, Brenda, are now homeschooling their five children.

A starling reassessment of Hitler&#39;s aims and motivations, Frederic Spotts&#39; Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics is an adroitly argued and highly original work that provides a key to fuller understanding of the Third Reich. Spotts convincingly demonstrates that contrary to the traditional view that Hitler had no life outside of politics, Hitler&#39;s interest in the arts was as intense as his racism-and that he used the arts to disguise the heinous crimes that were the means to fulfilling his ends. Hitler&#39;s vision of the Aryan superstate was to be expressed as much in art as in politics: culture was not only the end to which power should aspire, but the means of achieving it. Filled with evocative photographs and reproductions from Hitler&#39;s 1925 sketchbook, &#34;Spotts&#39;s study of the Fuhrer&#39;s fascination with architecture, painting, sculpture, and music is ...elegantly composed and richly documented&#34; (The New Yorker).</p><p>Frederic Spotts has written numerous books on European political and cultural affairs. His study of Bayreuth is regarded as the standard work on the subject. Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics was written while Spotts was a visiting scholar at the Institute for International Affairs at UC Berkeley.The opening paragraph and photo powerfully capture Spotts's argument: The Soviet army is soon to launch its final, devastating assault on Berlin; the British and the Americans are about to invade Germany from the west. And there sits Adolf Hitler, gazing longingly at a model of a rebuilt Linz, his hometown, which is slated to become a grandiose symbol of the Thousand-Year Reich. For Spotts, this proves what Hitler himself claimed: that he was at heart never a politician, but an artist. Spotts, who has written an acclaimed study of the Wagner festival at Bayreuth, tries to substantiate his thesis by providing a panorama of Hitler's artistic activities, including his failed career as a painter, the purge of Jews and others from the cultural sphere, and his personal patronage of artists, musicians and architects. According to Spotts, Hitler's essence is to be found in his desire to create an empire in which "true" German art could flourish as never before. Yet Spotts overlooks the fact that Hitler, in megalomaniacal fashion, also claimed mastery of engineering, history and military strategy. His primary focus was arguably not on art, but on the creation of a racial utopia. Art and politics were but two sides of the same, racially minted coin. Spotts provides a lively, encyclopedic account of Hitler and the arts, but a more comprehensive and nuanced portrait of the Fuhrer and the Nazi regime can be found in Ian Kershaw's two-volume biography, which will remain the standard work for many years to come. 100 b&amp;w and 4 color illus. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ed Emberley&#39;s Big Orange Drawing Book (Ed Emberley&#39;s Big Series)</h2><p>Provides step-by-step instructions for drawing people and animals using a minimum of line and circle combinations.</p><p>Ed Emberley is the author of the popular Drawing Book series.

It was the auspicious beginning of an odyssey that Tillman captures brilliantly, from escorting sister carrier <i>Hornet </i>as it launched the Doolittle Raiders against Tokyo in 1942, to playing leading roles in the pivotal battles of Midway and Guadalcanal, to undergoing the shattering nightmare of kamikaze strikes just three months before the end of the war.<br> <br>Barrett Tillman has been called &#x201c;the man who owns naval aviation history.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s mined official records and oral histories as well as his own interviews with the last surviving veterans who served on <i>Enterprise </i>to give us not only a stunning portrait of the ship&#x2019;s unique contribution to winning the Pacific war, but also unforgettable portraits of the men who flew from her deck and worked behind the scenes to make success possible. <i>Enterprise </i>is credited with sinking or wrecking 71 Japanese ships and destroying 911 enemy aircraft. She sank two of the four Japanese carriers lost at Midway and contributed to sinking the third. Additionally, 41 men who served in <i>Enterprise </i>had ships named after them.<br> <br>As with <i>Whirlwind, </i>Tillman&#x2019;s book on the air war against Japan, <i>Enterprise </i>focuses on the lower ranks&#x2014;the men who did the actual fighting. He puts us in the shoes of the teenage sailors and their captains and executive officers who ran the ship day-to-day. He puts us in the cockpits of dive bombers and other planes as they careen off <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s flight deck to attack enemy ships and defend her against Japanese attackers. We witness their numerous triumphs and many tragedies along the way. However, Tillman does not neglect the top brass&#x2014;he takes us into the ward rooms and headquarters where larger-than-life flag officers such as Chester Nimitz and William Halsey set the broad strategy for each campaign.<br> <br>But the main character in the book is the ship itself. &#x201c;The Big E&#x201d; was at once a warship and a human institution, vitally unique to her time and place.

The two women also shared vitas that were filled with childhood disappointments, humiliating public attention during crises, and the wrenching deaths of loved ones. But as Jane Scovell's new biography clearly shows, Oona O'Neill Chaplin lacked both the stoicism and personal passion of Jackie Onassis. Hers was a spirit too tender--and fundamentally fragile--to assert itself fully or survive independently for any period of time. Hence the book's apt subtitle, "Living in the Shadows."<p> With information culled from press clips, interviews with Chaplin's friends and contemporaries, and previous biographies of Eugene O'Neill, Scovell's book paints an engaging portrait of a privileged, potentially fabulous life gone way wrong. Most fittingly for their subsequent tortured relationship, Oona's parents--Eugene O'Neill and writer Agnes Boulton--met in a Greenwich Village bar dubbed the Hellhole. Eight years into their marriage, in which they flitted between Greenwich Village, Bermuda, Provincetown, Maine, and New Jersey, O'Neill abandoned the family life for the erstwhile actress Carlotta Monterey (christened Hazel Neilson Tharsing). Oona was two at the time. O'Neill, a boorish father, saw her only a handful of times before she turned 18; at that point, he disinherited her because he wasn't happy with the oozy publicity she was earning as a New York debutante. That same year, Oona moved out to Hollywood (in the hopes of pursuing an acting career), and met and married Charlie Chaplin, who was facing a scandalous paternity suit at that moment. Chaplin was 54, Oona was 18. She never worked again, and he was at the end of his career. They had eight children (the last when Chaplin was 72), and she stood by him till his death in 1977, spending most of their years together exiled in Sweden, where Chaplin had gone to avoid a host of problems with the U.S. government. After Chaplin's death, Oona returned to the U.S., where she lived 14 depressed, alcoholic years before dying at age 66 of cancer.</p><p> There's a breezy, slightly superficial tone to this book, despite Scovell's attempt to elucidate fully the potholes and vistas of Oona's dramatic roadmap. None of Oona's eight children, or close family members, seems to have talked to Scovell, nor did Scovell have any significant access to Oona's correspondence or other writing. Though her dramatic fade is well captured here, Oona never completely blooms in this book. <i>--Jean Lenihan</i></p>Devotion to genius characterizes the life of Eugene ONeills daughter and Charlie Chaplin's wife in this respectful overview. Drawing on extensive research, arts journalist Scovell (who has been co-author to Elizabeth Taylor and Kitty Dukakis) moves quickly from the proverbial family tree to chart the messier human trail left by mother Agnes Boulton O'Neill's flightiness and father Eugene's nearly lifelong absence and rejection of their daughter. Aside from a vivid fit of despair, Oona's youthful feelings are not deeply documented here. But her early actions are, as a beautiful New York society girl, Hollywood ingenue, and, at age 18, fourth wife to 54-year-old Chaplin. Though Scovell draws the requisite links between father O'Neill's neglect and Oona's need for Chaplin's adoration, the author doesnt dwell on them. She speculates that the mutual protection offered by the marriage somewhat diminished and compromised the couple's awareness of the world; Gold Rush co-star Georgia Hale even questions their unions perfection. But Scovell, like Oona's friends and family, largely accepts the idea that when a marriage lasts for four decades and produces eight children, one should stop seeking its flaws and instead celebrate its duration. As for whether Oona ever wanted more for herself, Scovells as clear as her research allows. She notes that Oona may have screamed, in her last days, ``What the f did I do with my life!'' but that she never sought artistic parity with Chaplin (and rejected invitations to write a memoir). Hardly a story of marital victimization, this tells instead of how Oona made a choice, lived her life afterward, and in Chaplin probably found exactly what she wanted: ``father, lover, provider and protector.'' Only upon his death did her drinking grow debilitating. Nevertheless, her dependent position and habitual self-effacement inevitably make Oona, however finely realized, a limited subject for a biography. A semi-hidden life of unbroken allegiance, compassionately rendered. (16 pages photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Slavery was a crucial factor, he observes: Southerners regarded it as part of their way of life. Northerners, on the other hand, combined morality and pragmatism in their acceptance of abolition as essential in preserving the Union. McPherson, however, perceives the Civil War basically as a struggle for the heritage of 1776, a struggle in which Southerners sought freedom from a tyrannical government, while Northerners believed the republican experiment could not survive if the legitimacy of secession were established. More than 80% of the war's combatants were literate, which may help to explain why McPherson's sources convincingly reflect the character and experience of the armies. Frontline idealism seemed to prevail on both sides, perhaps to the surprise of a more cynical 20th century. McPherson's emphasis on moral and ideological factors in war gives his book a significance well beyond its specific subject. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Union general Joshua Chamberlain once observed that because they fought for rights rather than pay or plunder, Civil War armies were almost unique in history. Numerous studies of the Civil War, and subsequent wars, have argued otherwise, noting that self-interest and survival more than ideology caused men to fight. Now distinguished historian McPherson (American history, Princeton Univ.) has entered the lists after examining several hundred Union and Confederate soldiers' diaries and letters. In a sprightly and forcefully argued book, based on a series of lectures and derived from a larger work-in-progress, McPherson finds that soldiers on both sides cherished concepts of liberty (even when defending slavery). Many historians will likely contest such findings, which seem more to characterize the first years of the war than the last, but all will owe McPherson much for revitalizing an important debate about the meaning of the Civil War.<br><i>- Randall M.

How long do you suppose, sir, that an hour is to a man who is choking for want of air?&#39; A masterly evocation of the state and psychology of imprisonment, Little Dorrit is one of the supreme works of Dickens&#39;s maturity. When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, he takes a kindly interest in Amy Dorrit, his mother&#39;s seamstress, and in the affairs of Amy&#39;s father, a man of shabby grandeur, long imprisoned for debt in the Marshalsea. As Arthur discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect many lives, from Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier.

From the author of HEARTWOOD, SUNSET LIMITED and CADILLAC JUKEBOX.</p><p>In New Iberia, Louisiana, memories are long and dangerous, and the past and present are seldom easy to untangle. Homicide investigator Dave Robicheaux is trying to help Letty Labiche, a New Iberia girl on death row for killing the man who molested her and her sister as children, when chance brings him to Zipper Clum, a pimp and pornographer who recognizes Robicheaux secondhand through a 30-year haze: <blockquote>"Robicheaux, your mama's name was Mae.... Wait, it was Guillory before she married. That was the name she went by ... Mae Guillory. But she was your mama," he said.<p> "What?" I said.</p><p> He wet his lips uncertainly.</p><p> "She dealt cards and still hooked a little bit. Behind a club in Lafourche Parish. This was maybe 1966 or '67," he said.</p><p> Clete's eyes were fixed on my face. "You're in a dangerous area, sperm breath," he said to Zipper.</p><p> "They held her down in a mud puddle. They drowned her," Zipper said.</p></blockquote> To Robicheaux, whose memories of the fun-loving Mae are few and bittersweet, the news comes like a bolt of lightning. Though she abandoned him to the uncertain mercies of a violent, alcoholic father, he loved her, and his desire to find her killers--cops in the pay of the Giacano crime family, according to Clum--is instantaneous and deeply felt. Unfortunately, Zipper Clum meets the wrong end of a .25 automatic soon after his electrifying announcement, but his conversation with his killer is recorded--and Mae Guillory's name comes up again. <p> The winding trail of evidence connected to both Letty Labiche and Mae Guillory leads Robicheaux almost immediately to Jim Gable, the New Orleans Police Department's liaison with city hall, whose position has afforded him a number of less-than-legal advantages. Gable also happens to be an ex-lover of Robicheaux's wife, Bootsie--formerly the widow of Ralph Giacano. From there the web of connections grows ever wider, and (not surprisingly) incriminates those in high places. These include the state attorney general, a woman who, if photographic evidence is to be trusted, was once friendly with the Labiches' parents, who were known procurers.</p><p> But if <i>Purple Cane Road</i> has its share of corrupt powermongers, it's also filled with beautifully rounded characters, like piano-playing governor Belmont Pugh and hit man Johnny Remeta, whose personality slowly begins to unravel as he gets closer to Robicheaux's daughter. The plot converges seamlessly to its climax--the true story of what happened to Mae Robicheaux--as James Lee Burke's trademark of uncompromising justice is brought to fruition. Like Burke's other Robicheaux novels, <i>Purple Cane Road</i> offers a solidly satisfying piece in the picture of a complex hero. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>From Edgar Award-winner James Lee Burke comes this emotional powerhouse of a novel ... in which everyman hero Dave Robicheaux confronts the secrets of his long-forgotten past in a shattering tale of revenge, murder, and a mother's haunting legacy.... <br>Robicheaux first hears it from a pimp eager to trade information for his life: Mae Guillory was murdered outside a New Orleans nightclub by two cops. Dave Robicheaux was just a boy when his mother ran out on him and his whiskey-driven father. <br>Now Robicheaux is a man, still haunted by her desertion and her death. More than thirty-five years after Mae Guillory died, her son will go to any length to bring her killers to justice. And as he moves closer to what happened that long-ago night, the Louisiana cop crosses lines of color and class to find the place where secrets of his past lie buried ... and where all roads lead to revenge -- but only one road leads to the truth....<br></p><h2>Pickles, Too: The Older I Get, The Better I Was</h2><p>A second collection of comic strips from the wildly popular Pickles.</p><p>For twenty-five years, <b>Brian Crane's</b> comic strip, <i>Pickles</i>, has been delighting readers around the world.

It filled an important gap in providing reliable guidance on sources for perhaps the most critical period in understanding a family s links with the north of Ireland. This is territory where some family historians fear to tread. But they need not. This guide opens up avenues for research; drawing attention to the riches of archives inside and outside of the island of Ireland, demonstrating the benefit of often undervalued, rare, even quite unconventional, yet accessible sources if you know where to look which can help document your ancestors back to the 1600s. At more than twice the size of the original, this new edition is a massively expanded version of the first volume. It includes additional information on church records and landed estate papers, as well as new chapters looking at records relating to law and order, emigration, business and occupations, diaries and journals, and clubs and societies. The extensive appendices to the book include a summary breakdown of the sources available from this period for every parish in the historic nine counties of Ulster (including a listing of surviving pre-1800 church records); a detailed description of around 350 collections of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century landed estate papers; and a listing of more than 500 towns and villages in Ulster with parish locations. Whether your ancestors are of English, Scottish or Gaelic Irish background, whether their religious affiliation was Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic or other, whether they were farmers, merchants or labourers, this volume will be of enormous value to anyone wishing to find out more about their Ulster roots.</p><p></p><h2>The Brothers: A Novel (The Great and Terrible, Volume 1 -- Prologue)</h2><p>In the time before Creation, before so many of the children of God turned away from their Father and walked knowingly into the dark, there was a choosing, a sifting, a contest of ideas and a battle for souls.

First published in 1961, Raul Hilberg&#x2019;s comprehensive account of how Germany annihilated the Jewish community of Europe spurred discussion, galvanized further research, and shaped the entire field of Holocaust studies. This revised and expanded edition of Hilberg&#x2019;s classic work extends the scope of his study and includes 80,000 words of new material, particularly from recently opened archives in eastern Europe, added over a lifetime of research. It is the work of a scholar who has devoted more than fifty years to exploring and analyzing the realities of the Holocaust. <br><br>Spanning the twelve-year period of anti-Jewish actions from 1933 to 1945, Hilberg&#x2019;s study encompasses Germany and all the territories under German rule or influence. Its principal focus is on the large number of perpetrators&#x2015;civil servants, military personnel, Nazi party functionaries, SS men, and representatives of private enterprises&#x2015;in the machinery of death. <br></p><p><b>Raul Hilberg </b>is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Vermont.<br>No single book has contributed more ... to an understanding of Nazi genocide....

While Patricia Thomas's account of the race for the AIDS vaccine begins about the same time, it took 16 years (and over 400 pages) for a vaccine to begin an efficacy trial, and then only because a group of desperate scientists took it into their own hands to raise the funds and go it alone without government support. While the disease itself has greatly resisted scientific study--it breaks all the rules, is not easily fooled, and continues to develop new strains--that's only one impediment in what has turned into a crawl towards the only real solution to the AIDS crisis. "HIV vaccine research has been a kind of low-prestige backwater that never, until recently, claimed more than 10 percent of federal spending on AIDS," Thomas writes. The development of a vaccine has been hampered by social attitudes and bureaucratic misapprehension, corporate lethargy (vaccine development entails higher costs and liability than therapeutic drugs), and the politics and big egos at such places as the National Institute for Health. Thomas closely follows some of the more passionate and heroic players who have forged ahead even while their companies waffle on vaccine research--young and idealistic biotech scientists like Kathy Steimer of Chiron Corporation, who worked at the cutting edge of immunology until her own untimely death, and Phil Berman and Don Francis (portrayed in <i>And the Band Played On</i>), who left the highly competitive company Genentech to launch the lone large-scale test. There are also the pioneers of naked DNA, such as Margaret Liu at Merck, who bet her rising career on the radical technology despite the fact that her vaccine took a back seat to the company's efforts to develop a treatment that would help far fewer people. <p> Thomas does an admirable job with a huge and complicated subject, using vivid metaphors to explain such topics as recombinant DNA, antigens, and virology, but unfortunately she seems compelled to tell every last detail, which makes for a sometimes tedious read.

B. Parkinson, a curator of ancient Egyptian culture at the British Museum, is internationally recognized as a specialist in ancient Egyptian poetry. His other publications include <i>Voices from Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Middle Kingdom Writings</i>; <i>The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems, 1940&#x2013;1640 B.C.</i>; and <i>Poetry and Culture in Middle Kingdom Egypt: A Dark Side to Perfection</i>.Through meticulous research and compassionate narration, British Museum curator Parkinson (Voices from Ancient Egypt) brings to light a collection of art objects from the British Museum&#39;s collection that illustrate same-sex desire, many of which had previously been censored or concealed from historians. These 40 objects come from various civilizations and eras, some being clear-cut examples of same-sex love, such as Grecian urns decorated with homoerotic scenes, the poetry of Sappho, and the Roman Emperor Hadrian&#39;s well-documented affair with the young Antinous. Other pieces are more ambiguous: artistic renderings that suggest love between Samurai warriors; an Ancient Egyptian tomb that may have been made for a same-sex couple; and Shakespearean sonnets that allude to bisexual relationships. The book also includes brief, captivating profiles of gay and lesbian artists, including the sculptors Hedwig Marquardt and Augusta Kaiser, and novelist Virginia Woolf. The long history of intolerance is interwoven through the artwork as well, and while facts surrounding the persecution and execution of sodomites are unsettling, the book is not overtly political. Parkinson successfully shows that same-sex love and desire are an integral part of human history: On a long view, no one occupies the centre. It belongs to all of us. 80 color photos.

Named for his father&#x2019;s drowned Labrador retriever, Rove is a strong-shouldered and self-reliant sixteen-year-old, an uneven match for his volatile father, Captain Dominus MacNee. Though he sometimes wishes the whiskey-soaked man would be lost at sea, Rove himself is in danger of sinking in the troubled waters of his home life. <br><br>Navigating between memoir and memory, past and present, Rove reflects upon the people and pursuits that have influenced his life: his passion for fishing, where the toss of the net is more thrilling than the catch in the bucket; his much-loved grandmother, who gives him a copy of Huckleberry Finn, saying, &#x201c;Boys sometimes run away, you know&#x201d;; and Anna Pearl Anderson, &#x201c;the prettiest girl on the Eastern shore,&#x201d; who ignites in Rove the first flickers of romance. Yet his greatest treasure, perhaps, is his twenty-five-foot sloop, the Sea Bird. Given to him as a gift, the Sea Bird brings with it both the possibility of salvation and the threat of disaster. As Rove dreams of escaping his tumultuous surroundings, it becomes apparent that he can never truly shake the hold of his seaside home unless he confronts, head on, a startling truth.<br><br>Returning to the setting of his much-lauded debut novel, The Poet of Tolstoy Park, Sonny Brewer, once again, gives a skillful performance in the Southern storytelling tradition. A Sound Like Thunder is a magnificently crafted tale of a man revisiting the crossroads of his life, connecting the fragmented keepsakes in his heart and mind, and reemerging with a clear understanding of his defining moment.</p><p>Sonny Brewer is the author of The Poet of Tolstoy Park. He started Over the Transom Bookshop in Fairhope, Alabama and is board chairman of the nonprofit Fairhope Center for the Writing Arts. He is the former editor in chief of Mobile Bay Monthly; he also published and edited Eastern Shore Quarterly magazine, edited Red Bluff Review, and was founding associate editor of the weekly West Alabama Gazette. Brewer is the editor of the acclaimed annual five-volume anthology of Southern writing Stories from the Blue Moon Cafe.November 1941<br><br> Thunder, low and trembling, rolled across the breezeless bay, and I wondered from where I stood on the shaky wooden dock if the sheer weight of the sound could set tiny ripples in motion on the water&#x2019;s smooth face. The cypress two-by planking beneath my bare feet was weather-cracked and silvered. Many of the narrow wharf&#x2019;s rusting nails were loosened and backing out of the joists, allowing random boards to cup and twist, and the protruding nails to snag and bloody a boy&#x2019;s bare toes.<br><br> Gray dawn had not long since arisen, and my mother would be stirring the house to life, waking my younger brother, just turned ten. She would also awaken my grandmother, who had moved in with us soon after Grandpa Otis died.<br><br> My father was not at home, and the world was quiet.<br><br> Along this stretch of Alabama bayfront, no windows I could see were yet yellow with light, and I saw no one else moving. Ten or so miles to the north and west there on the other shore, across the smoky water the city of Mobile was still sleeping.<br><br> My father was captain of the Mary Foster, a fifty-foot melon schooner on a run to the New Basin Canal&#x2013;front market out past Hagan Street in New Orleans. He was due back any day, maybe this morning, and usually drove home in his Ford truck from Farragut&#x2019;s Basin, where he kept the schooner at anchor. The captain called the basin Farragut&#x2019;s Turn, as did some of the older schoonermen, because it was the spot on Fish River where Admiral David Farragut, after the Civil War Battle of Mobile Bay, had found room enough to turn his gunboats around.<br><br> Sometimes, if the weather was fine, the captain would leave his truck at Farragut&#x2019;s and motor his broad skiff up the bay from the pass at Big Mouth, dropping off crew and deckhands at this or that fishing camp strung out down the bay. Now that I was sixteen and legal to drive, I would sometimes be sent back in the skiff to Farragut&#x2019;s to fetch home the truck, and I looked forward to those little excursions because I loved to drive. The run south down the bay alone in the skiff, my face skinning the wind and my hand twisting the throttle on the Evinrude, was almost as much fun.<br><br> My name is Rover, named for my father&#x2019;s beloved shining black Labrador retriever that drowned in the wind-tossed waves of Mobile Bay while chasing a wounded mallard. The dog had paddled madly and happily, one might guess, after the duck through the frothy chop until he sank in exhaustion in five feet of brackish water not a hundred yards offshore from our bayside cottage the day before I was born.<br><br> The captain, in naming his son after his dog, had revealed a sense of humor that I had failed to inherit. I came up short of laughing each time I fought this or that taunting schoolmate who called me Rover. On my first day of school, I had dropped the last &#x201c;r&#x201d; and given my name as Rove, a name I did not mind actually. Anyone who added back the &#x201c;r&#x201d; and addressed me so had a fight on his hands. Years later David MacFarland would lift his upper lip with his index finger and show me a chipped tooth, would turn loose his lip, and let it segue into a smile and tell me parents should be more careful what they name their kids. We were fourteen when I punched him in the mouth. I walked away with a torn knuckle on my right hand, a scar to match David&#x2019;s chip.<br><br> With this weather building, my father would drive instead of motoring up the bay in the skiff. Even knowing that, I looked south down the bay. I saw no skiff. I let my eyes sweep the horizon and a steam passenger ferry, an elongated black shape some miles across the flat water, was trailing a thin tendril of smoke into the dull pewter sky. It was the only thing moving on Mobile Bay as far as I could see. I lifted my shoulders against a cold shiver starting down my neck. The November morning still held the chill from last night&#x2019;s low temperature which had dipped to near forty degrees.<br><br> It would storm today. This odd stillness would soon be shattered, rough weather probably setting in before the Bay Queen made the dock at Stedman&#x2019;s Landing, three or so miles up the shore north of Fairhope. If I did not hurry home I might get caught in the rain, which, in fact, I did not mind. But, on the other hand, if I did not hurry, there was some chance that my father would be already seated at the kitchen table. I did not want to come into the house after him.<br><br> My preference, in fact, if it were not for leaving Mother alone to deal with the captain, would be to stay away entirely.<br><br> I had worked the deck on the Mary Foster, and I knew that when the captain sailed home, done with the white-shirted dealers in New Orleans who had haggled down his prices, done with the sweating thick-armed roustabouts who off-loaded the fat, striped melons&#x2014;or in other seasons sweet potatoes or turpentine or what have you&#x2014;and when his crew had piled them onto waiting trucks, when the captain had heeled to breezes across Lake Pontchartrain, negotiated the currents in the pass at the Rigolets and into Lake Borgne, laid down the lee rail in gusts across the Mississippi Sound, ghosted past Dauphin Island and Fort Gaines to starboard and made his cut northward into Mobile Bay with Fort Morgan off his stern quarter, when he had pointed the bow of the Mary Foster east into the narrow mouth of Weeks Bay, then slid the schooner between Fish River&#x2019;s twisty and wooded banks, bending around curve after curve those short four miles upstream to Farragut&#x2019;s Basin, when he had anchored there with the rest of the schooner fleet, then the good captain was ready for a bottle of Scotch whiskey.<br><br> I also knew, because I overheard the accusations from Mother and heard no attendant denial from my father, that the captain sometimes carried on with Creole whores at Lanaux&#x2019;s Landing in Magnolia Springs, and lay out drunk for several days instead of coming home when the Mary Foster returned to port. And when he&#x2019;d had a sailor&#x2019;s fill of this merriment, the captain would drive through the farmlands rattling along Baldwin County back roads to our home south of Fairhope near Battles Wharf. Captain Dominus MacNee&#x2019;s homecomings were usually at the breakfast hour; they were usually noisy and threatening.<br><br> In the last two years, that long since the captain seemed to have stepped into an abyss and dragged himself out another man entirely, I had grown to sometimes hate for my father to come home, and sometimes secretly wished he would drown at sea. I believed there was at least some chance it might happen. And nights in my dream-rumpled bed, when that bad thing had there in the dark come to pass, I would awaken in tears already missing him.<br><br> Because my father might be coming home this morning, and because a profaning drunk at the breakfast table would be enough for Mother to manage without wondering after my whereabouts, and because I wished for the small advantage I might gain from being first ahead of the captain in Mother&#x2019;s kitchen, I thought I might better get on home. I should coil my cast net down into the galvanized bucket beside my bare feet on the dock, take up its bail, and begin walking down the bluff overlooking the bay toward home.<br><br> It was enough of a hardship on my mother that my grandmother was sickly, and enough for her to get my reluctant brother Julian moving in the morning. I should start now walking that way, and then there crossed the plain of my mind a shadow, something wheeling high up and indistinguishable, but bearing some likeness to pain. So I stood stock-still and looked out across the water&#x2019;s surface, settling my mind into something real, and letting my imaginings slip away.</p><h2>On Top of Concord Hill (Little House Prequel)</h2><p><p>The Little House books have captivated millions of readers with their story of Laura Ingalls, a little pioneer girl growing up on the American frontier.

Graham Swift&#39;s work has appeared in over thirty languages.ONCE UPON A TIME,&nbsp;before the boys were killed and when there were more horses than cars, before the male servants disappeared and they made do, at Upleigh and at Beechwood, with just a cook and a maid, the Sheringhams had owned not just four horses in their own stable, but what might be called a &#x201c;real horse,&#x201d; a racehorse, a thoroughbred. Its name was Fandango. It was stabled near Newbury. It had never won a damn thing. But it was the family&#x2019;s indulgence, their hope for fame and glory on the racecourses of southern England. The deal was that Ma and Pa&#x2014;otherwise known in his strange language as &#x201c;the shower&#x201d;&#x2014;owned the head and body and he and Dick and Freddy had a leg each.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the fourth leg?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh the fourth leg. That was always the question.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of the time it was just a name, never seen, though an expensively quartered and trained name. It had been sold in 1915&#x2014;when he&#x2019;d been fifteen too. &#x201c;Before you showed up, Jay.&#x201d; But once, long ago, early one June morning, they&#x2019;d all gone, for the strange, mad expedition of it, just to watch it, just to watch Fandango, their horse, being galloped over the downs. Just to stand at the rail and watch it, with other horses, thundering towards them, then flashing past. He and Ma and Pa and Dick and Freddy. And&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;some other ghostly interested party who really owned the fourth leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had a hand on her leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the only time she&#x2019;d known his eyes go anything close to misty. And she&#x2019;d had the clear sharp vision (she would have it still when she was ninety) that she might have gone with him&#x2014;might still somehow miraculously go with him, just him&#x2014;to stand at the rail and watch Fandango hurtle past, kicking up the mud and dew. She had never seen such a thing but she could imagine it, imagine it clearly. The sun still coming up, a red disc, over the grey downs, the air still&nbsp;crisp and cold, while he shared with her, perhaps, a silver-capped hip flask and, not especially stealthily, clawed her arse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> BUT SHE WATCHED&nbsp;him now move, naked but for a silver signet ring, across the sunlit room. She would not later in life use with any readiness, if at all, the word &#x201c;stallion&#x201d; for a man. But such he was. He was twenty-three and she was twenty-two. And he was even what you might call a thoroughbred, though she did not have that word then, any more than she had the word &#x201c;stallion.&#x201d; She did not yet have a million words. Thoroughbred: since it was &#x201c;breeding&#x201d; and &#x201c;birth&#x201d; that counted with his kind. Never mind to what actual purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 1924. It wasn&#x2019;t June, but it was a day like June. And it must have been a little after noon. A window was flung open, and he walked, unclad, across the sun-filled room as carelessly as any unclad animal. It was his room, wasn&#x2019;t it? He could do what he liked in it. He clearly could. And she had never been in it before, and never would be again.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she was naked too.<br> &nbsp;<br> March 30th 1924. Once upon a time. The shadows from the latticework in the window slipped over him like foliage. Having gathered up the cigarette case and lighter and a little silver ashtray from the dressing table, he turned, and there, beneath a nest of dark hair and fully bathed by sunshine, were his cock and balls, mere floppy and still sticky appendages. She could look at them if she liked, he didn&#x2019;t mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then he could look at her. She was stretched out naked, except for a pair&#x2014;her only pair&#x2014;of very cheap earrings. She hadn&#x2019;t pulled up the sheet. She had even clasped her hands behind her head the better to look at him. But he could look at her. Feast your eyes. It was an expression that came to her. Expressions had started to come to her. Feast your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside, all Berkshire stretched out too, girded with bright greenery, loud with birdsong, blessed in March with a day in June.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was still a follower of horses. That is, he still threw money away on them. It was his version of economising, to throw money away. For nearly eight years he&#x2019;d had money for three, in theory. He called it &#x201c;loot.&#x201d; But he would show he could do without it. And what the two of them had been doing for almost seven years cost, as he would sometimes remind her, absolutely nothing. Except secrecy and risk and cunning and a mutual aptitude for being good at it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they had never done anything like this. She had never been in this bed before&#x2014;it was a single bed, but roomy. Or in this room, or in this house. If it cost nothing, then this was the greatest of gifts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though if it cost nothing, she might always remind him, then what about the times when he&#x2019;d given her sixpences? Or was it even threepences? When it was only just beginning, before it got&#x2014;was it the right word?&#x2014;serious. But she would never dare remind him. And not now anyway. Or dare throw at him the word &#x201c;serious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat on the bed beside her. He ran a hand across her belly as if brushing away invisible dust. Then he arranged on it the lighter and ashtray, retaining the cigarette case. He took two cigarettes from the case, putting one in her own proffered, pouting lips. She had not taken her hands from the back of her head. He lit hers, then his. Then, gathering up the case and lighter to put on the bedside table, he stretched out beside her, the ashtray still positioned halfway between her navel and what these days he would happily, making no bones about it, call her &#x201c;cunt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cock, balls, cunt. There were some simple, basic expressions.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 30th. It was a Sunday. It was what used to be known as Mothering Sunday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;WELL,&nbsp;you have a gorgeous day for it, Jane,&#x201d; Mr. Niven had said as she brought in fresh coffee and toast.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said and she&#x2019;d wondered quite what he meant by &#x201c;it&#x201d; in her case.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A truly gorgeous day.&#x201d; As if it were something he had generously provided. And then to Mrs. Niven, &#x201c;You know, if someone had told us it was going to be like this, we might as well have all packed hampers. A picnic&#x2014;by the river.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He said it wistfully, yet eagerly, so that, putting down the toast rack, she&#x2019;d thought for an instant there might actually be a change of plan and she and Milly would be required to pack a hamper. Wherever the hamper&nbsp;<i>was</i>, and whatever they were supposed to put in it at such inconsiderate notice. This being&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Mrs. Niven had said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s March, Godfrey,&#x201d; with a distrusting glance towards the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, she&#x2019;d been wrong. The day had only got better.<br> &nbsp;<br> And anyway the Nivens had their plan, on which the weather could only smile. They were to drive to Henley to meet the Hobdays and the Sheringhams. Given their common predicament&#x2014;which only occurred once a year and only for a portion of one day&#x2014;they were all to meet for lunch at Henley and so deal with the temporary bother of having no servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the Hobdays&#x2019; idea&#x2014;or invitation. Paul Sheringham was to marry Emma Hobday in just two weeks&#x2019; time. So the Hobdays had suggested to the Sheringhams an outing for lunch: an opportunity to toast and talk over the forthcoming event, as well as a solution to Sunday&#x2019;s practical difficulty. And then because the Nivens were close friends and neighbours of the Sheringhams and would be honoured guests at the wedding (and would have the same difficulty), the Nivens&#x2014;as Mr. Niven had put it to her when first notifying her of these arrangements&#x2014;had been &#x201c;roped in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This had all made clear one thing she knew already. Whatever else Paul Sheringham was marrying, he was marrying money. Perhaps he had to, the way he got through his own. The Hobdays would be paying in two weeks&#x2019; time for a grand wedding, and did you really need to celebrate a forthcoming celebration? Not unless you had plenty to spare. It might demand nothing less than champagne. When Mr. Niven had mentioned the hamper he had perhaps been wondering how much the Hobdays&#x2019; liberality could be relied on or how much the day might involve his own pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that the Hobdays had plenty to spare pleased her. It had nothing to do with her, but it pleased her. That Emma Hobday might be made of five-pound notes, that the marriage might be an elaborate way of obtaining &#x201c;loot,&#x201d; pleased or, rather, consoled her. It was all the other things it might entail that&#x2014;even as Mr. Niven explained about the &#x201c;roping in&#x201d;&#x2014;gnawed at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> And would Mister Paul and Miss Hobday be joining the party themselves? She couldn&#x2019;t really ask it directly, vital as it was to her to know. And Mr. Niven didn&#x2019;t volunteer the information.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mention these arrangements to Milly? None of it of course need affect&#x2014;your own arrangements.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not often that he had the occasion to say such a thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A jamboree in Henley, Jane. A meeting of the tribes. Let&#x2019;s hope we have the weather for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what &#x201c;jamboree&#x201d; meant, though she felt she had read the word somewhere. But &#x201c;jam&#x201d; suggested something jolly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope so too, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> AND NOW&nbsp;they clearly had the weather for it, and Mr. Niven, whatever his earlier misgivings, was indeed getting rather jolly. He was going&nbsp;to be driving himself. He had already announced that they might as well set off soon, so they could &#x201c;pootle around&#x201d; and take advantage of such a lovely morning. He wouldn&#x2019;t, apparently, be calling on Alf at the garage, who&#x2014;for the right sum&#x2014;could become a convincing chauffeur. In any case, as she&#x2019;d observed over recent years, Mr. Niven liked driving. He even preferred the pleasure of driving to the dignity of being driven. It gave him a boyish zest. And as he was always saying, with a whole variety of intonations, ranging from bluster to lament, times were changing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time, after all, the Nivens would have met the Sheringhams at Sunday service.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tribes&#x201d; had suggested something hot and outdoors. She knew it was to be the George Hotel in Henley. It was not to be a picnic. And it might well have been a day, since it was still March, of evil gales, even snow. But it was a morning like a morning in summer. And Mrs. Niven left the table to go up to get herself ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> She couldn&#x2019;t ask, even now with Mr. Niven conveniently alone, &#x201c;Would Miss Hobday and...?&#x201d; Even if it sounded like just a maid&#x2019;s idle curiosity. Wasn&#x2019;t the coming wedding the only current talking-point? And she certainly couldn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;If not, then what other separate arrangements might the two of them have in mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t think that if she were one half of a betrothed couple&#x2014;or at least Paul Sheringham&#x2019;s half&#x2014;she would want, two weeks before their wedding, to attend a jamboree in Henley to be fussed over by the older generation (by what he might have called&#x2014;she could see him speaking with a cigarette in his mouth and wincingly screwing up his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;three bloody showers together&#x201d;).<br> &nbsp;<br> But in any case, if she got no further information, it still left the problem that was peculiarly hers on this day, as Mr. Niven knew, of what to do with it. Today it was painfully peculiar. The gorgeous weather didn&#x2019;t necessarily help at all. It only seemed&#x2014;with two weeks to go&#x2014;to deepen a shadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was going to say to Mr. Niven, when the moment came, that if he&#x2014;if he and Mrs. Niven&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t mind, she might not &#x201c;go&#x201d; anywhere. She might just stay here at Beechwood and read a book if that was all right&#x2014;&#x201c;her book&#x201d; as she might put it, though it belonged to Mr. Niven. She might just sit somewhere in the sunshine in the garden.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew that Mr. Niven could only approve of such a harmless suggestion. He might even think it was a rather appealing image. And of course it would mean she&#x2019;d be ready to resume her duties at once, whenever they returned. She could find something to eat in the kitchen. Milly, before she left, might even make her a sandwich. She could have her own &#x201c;picnic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And it might even have happened just like that. The bench in the nook by the sundial. Bumblebees tricked by the weather. The magnolia tree already loaded with blossom. Her book on her lap. She knew which book it would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> So&#x2014;she would put the idea to Mr. Niven.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then the telephone had rung and&#x2014;it being one of her numberless duties&#x2014;she&#x2019;d hastened to answer it. And her heart had soared. That was a phrase you read in books, but it was sometimes actually true of what happened to people. It was true then of herself. Her heart had soared, like some stranded heroine&#x2019;s in a story. Like the larks she would hear in a little while, trilling and soaring high in the blue sky, as she pedalled her way to Upleigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she&#x2019;d been careful to say, quite loudly, into the receiver and with her best answering-the-telephone voice that was both maid-like and somewhat queenly, &#x201c;Yes, madam.&#x201d;</p><h2>Texas Vendetta (Texas Rangers)</h2><p><p>In this fifth volume of his Texas Rangers series, Elmer Kelton takes the young ranger Andy Pickard, once a Comanche captive called Badger Boy, into the midst of a bloody vendetta between hate-filled families. Pickard and ranger Farley Brackett, a former Confederate soldier, are assigned to deliver prisoner Jayce Landon to the sheriff of a neighboring county to stand trial for killing a man named Ned Hopper but from the outset the seemingly simple assignment gets complicated. The Landon and Hopper families are in a blood feud; the Landons are gathering to free Jayce, and the Hoppers are gathering to kill him.</p><p>Filled with the author's always engaging characters and set in the historically accurate backdrop of post-Civil War Texas, <i>Texas Vendetta</i> chronicles the pinnacle era of the legendary Texas Rangers.</p></p><p><p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>For the last twelve or fifteen miles Andy Pickard and Farley Brackett had ridden in almost total silence. One ignored his partner, and the other tried to. They talked no more than the surefooted little Mexican pack mule that followed them across the Texas hill country's rocky ground. That suited Andy fine, for Farley was unlikely to say anything he wanted to listen to. <br>Andy speculated that the Ranger captain might have been sore at him for some reason, detailing him with dour Farley Brackett on this locate-and-arrest mission. The captain had said, "Brackett's a man I'd like to have beside me in a fight, but be damned if I'd want him for company before and after." <br>Farley usually looked as if he had just come back from a funeral. The captain had probably been glad to get him out of camp for two or three days and let the sunshine in. <br>Andy had to squint, riding directly into the setting sun. "Fixin' to be sundown pretty quick." <br>Farley grunted as if to say he could see that for himself and he resented the break in silence. <br>Night was going to catch them before they reached the Leach place. That was all right with Andy. He liked a little low-level excitement, but he had no interest in getting killed. He said, "We'd make too good a target ridin' up in broad daylight anyway. Captain told us those folks are apt to put up a fight if we don't catch them off guard." <br>Farley's eyes were as grim as the muzzle of a shotgun. "Anybody is liable to put up a fight when they're lookin' at a stretch in the penitentiary. These people ain't bright, but even a fool can sight down a gun barrel and kill you." <br>Andy and Farley carried a warrant for the arrest of one Joseph Branford on a charge of robbery and attempted murder. He had ambushed a stock farmer back in Colorado County, leaving him for dead after taking money the farmer had collected for selling a team of mules. The captain had received a tip that Branford was hiding out north of the Llano River on a hardscrabble homestead operated by his sister and her husband, Banner Leach. Leach claimed to be a farmer, but he was suspected of operating a way station for stolen livestock. No one had been able to prove it to the satisfaction of a jury. <br>So far as the captain could determine, Leach was not currently wanted by the law despite his shady reputation. However, it was probably only a matter of time before he was caught knee-deep in some ill-conceived activity that would put his name on the Rangers' fugitive list. <br>Farley said, "If we was to shoot them both, the taxpayers wouldn't have to foot the cost of a trial." <br>Coming from some people, that would be considered idle talk. In Farley's case, Andy doubted it was idle. "There's no charges out against Leach." <br>"There will be sooner or later. Shoot him now and we'll save some squatter from gettin' his livestock stolen." <br>Andy could see a certain twisted logic in Farley's view of summary justice, but it went against many stern lectures peace officers like Rusty Shannon had preached to him about the importance of law, about the presumption of innocence until guilt was proven. He wished he had Rusty with him now instead of Farley. "Rangers don't go around shootin' prisoners." <br>"Wake up and look around you, boy. Sometimes justice gets served out in the brush, where there's no witnesses. No petty-foggin' lawyers, no bought-off jury. Time you get a few more years on you, you'll know what I mean." <br>Farley had touched a sore spot. Andy was evidently the youngest man in the company, though nobody knew his age. The best guess was twenty years or a little more. Indians had killed his father and mother when he was small and had carried him off to raise as their own. Circumstances had thrust him back into Texan hands about the time his voice began to change. He had had to learn English all over again and stumble along on the white man's road, learning the hard way by trial and error--lots of error. Even with Rusty Shannon's guidance, it had been a rough road to follow after knowing only the ways of the Comanche. <br>He was keenly aware that he still looked young to be riding with the Rangers. He had recently tried growing a mustache in an effort to appear older. He had shaved it off after three weeks because it looked pathetically thin and weak. <br>Farley had remarked, "Old men try to look young, and young men try to look like their daddies. They're all lyin' to theirselves." <br>Andy was aware that an element of truth existed behind Farley's talk about shooting prisoners. He had heard whispered stories about outlaws shot "trying to escape." If a man was considered dangerous, it was safer to carry him in dead. And a quick burial was cheaper on the county. No criminal ever climbed out of the grave to file an appeal. <br>Many people were afraid of Farley Brackett, with cause. He had come home from the Yankee war with a long scar on his face and a deeper one etched into his soul. During Reconstruction years he had become a scourge to the federally backed authorities. The unionist state police had chased him often but had learned from bitter experience not to get close enough to catch him. <br>Once the old-time Texans regained political control of their state, transgressions against the former government had been forgiven, even applauded. The reorganized Rangers had been glad to have Farley join their ranks. He knew how men on the dodge thought and acted because he had been one. Andy thought he still had the shifty wolf eyes of a fugitive. <br>In the fading light of dusk Andy could make out a dim wagon trail. "You sure these tracks lead to the Leach place?" <br>Farley grumped, "Of course I'm sure. I'm always sure. I came this way before, huntin' a pal of Leach's that stuck up a Dutchman over in Friedrichsburg. Leach tried to point me onto the wrong trail. I ought to've shot him when I had the chance. We wouldn't have anybody to worry about now but Bransford." <br>They followed the wagon tracks until Andy saw lamplight ahead. "Looks like we've found the cabin." <br>"It never was lost. I knew where it was at." <br>"I guess we'll wait till they're asleep, then bust in?" <br>Farley assumed command by right of seniority and age. He looked at Andy as if the suggestion were the dumbest thing he had ever heard. "No, we'll make a dry camp and wait for mornin'. Bust in now and we'd have Bransford and Leach both to fight. That ain't countin' the woman, but I expect she'll just scream, faint, and fall down." <br>Andy argued, "In the mornin' they'll all be awake." <br>"We'll wait till the men are separated so we can handle them one at a time. Last time I was here, Leach came out about daylight to milk. We'll surprise him at the cow lot." <br>"And Bransford?" <br>"He'll give up when he sees we're fixin' to burn the cabin down around him." <br>"Or he'll come out shootin'." <br>"Good. We can finish him off legal and proper." <br>Andy protested, "We can't burn a cabin with a woman in it." <br>"She'll come out soon as her skirts start smokin'. With people like them, you don't ask permission or beg their pardon." <br>"I doubt the adjutant general would approve of it." <br>"The adjutant general!" Farley snorted. "Sittin' comfortable at a desk in Austin, writin' rules like he was dealin' with law-abidin' citizens. Out here the owl hoots in the daytime same as at night, and things look a lot different." <br>They moved back to the far side of a cedar-crowned hill where they could build a small fire without its being seen from the cabin. Farley commanded, "Cook us somethin' fit to eat." <br>Andy started to say, <i>You're a private same as me</i>, but changed his mind. The day might come when he had a showdown with Farley, but it would have to be over something more important than this. He took a pack from the back of the mule while Farley coaxed a small pile of dead wood into a blaze. Andy wished he had some of the dried buffalo meat that Comanches carried on long rides or the pemmican they made by pounding dried meat, berries, and nuts together. He preferred it over fatback broiled on the end of a stick. But he would settle for fatback because that was what he and Farley had brought, that and cold biscuits dried hard enough to drive a nail. <br>He knew no fat Rangers. <br>Water from their canteens yielded a cup of coffee apiece. Farley sat back, stretching his long legs, and slowly sipped his coffee as he might nurse a shot of whiskey. He seemed to withdraw into some private part of his mind, as distant as if he were back in the company headquarters camp on the San Saba River. <br>Andy broke a long silence. "I wish Rusty was with us." Rusty Shannon had taken charge of Andy when he was separated from the Comanches. He had become like an older brother. <br>"What's the matter, Badger Boy? You need a nursemaid?" <br>Farley took perverse pleasure in using the English version of the name by which the Comanches had known Andy. He was like some malevolent shaman who could summon up a dark and rumbling cloud from a bright and sunny sky. <br>Andy said, "Rusty always knows what to do." <br>"He's not a Ranger anymore, and it's probably a good thing. He always allowed the other feller too much of an edge. Sooner or later he'd get himself killed takin' pity on people that have got no pity comin' to them." <br>That was one thing Farley could never be accused of, Andy thought. "Rusty had pity on <i>me</i> when I needed help. And God knows I caused him trouble enough for a while." <br>Rusty had taken Andy into his log-cabin home on the Colorado River. He had managed to maintain his patience while Andy made the slow and painful transition from Comanche life. Andy had run away more than once, trying to return to his adoptive Indian family. He had fistfought boys for miles around when they ridiculed him for the Indian braids he refused to cut and the moccasins he wore instead of shoes. <br>The braids were gone now, and so were the moccasins. He wanted to fit in, to be the kind of Ranger Rusty had been. But he retained a remnant of Indian upbringing. It would probably always be there. <br>Drinking his bitter coffee, he lapsed into silence, pondering tomorrow and wishing he were as sure of himself as Farley seemed to be. <br>* * * <br>Morning was a long time in coming. Andy lay awake most of the night, visualizing the expected confrontation, imagining the worst that might happen. He pictured Leach's woman lying dead after the smoke cleared, much as he had seen his white mother dead years ago. It was one of his earliest memories, long suppressed because it was so terrible. The image still returned from time to time like a nightmare that would not wait for the night. <br>Farley seemed to harbor no misgivings. Andy listened to him snoring peacefully. <br>The stars still glittered when Farley came out from beneath his blanket. He looked up at them to get a rough notion of time. "We'd better be gettin' ourselves in position before daylight. Leach wakes up the rooster." <br>Andy was hungry. "Hadn't we ought to fix some breakfast first?" <br>"When we're done we'll make Leach's woman cook us a proper meal." <br>"Thought you were goin't to burn her cabin down." <br>"They raise pigs. We'll catch us a juicy shoat and have her roast it over the coals." <br>Andy started to pack the mule. Farley stopped him. "Don't you know a stupid mule is liable to smell feed and go in there brayin' his head off? We'll leave him here and pick him up when the job is done." <br>Chastened, Andy tied the mule. <br>The cabin was still dark as the two Rangers circled around to come in behind the milk shed. They left their horses in a clump of trees. The cow stood outside the gate, waiting in bovine patience for the grain that awaited her in the stanchion. She turned her head to watch the men approach on foot. She seemed to know they were strangers and drew away. She did not go far because she had not yet nursed her calf or had her morning feed. Hogs in a nearby pen grunted but quickly settled back down. Andy's nose pinched. He never had gotten used to the smell of pigs. Horses disliked them, and so did Comanches. <br>Presently he saw lamplight in the cabin window. A man came out carrying a bucket. <br>Farley said, "That's Leach. He's meaner than a boar hog with the hives. Be ready for real trouble." <br>"You don't figure on shootin' him, do you?" <br>"Not without he gives me cause. But if he gives me cause I sure won't take a chance with him." <br>Andy's hands were tense on his rifle. He could handle a pistol, but a rifle felt steadier and seemed to carry more authority. He could not see if Leach was armed. The man's face was featureless in the dim light of early dawn, but Andy could see that his body was broad and muscular. He looked as if he would be hard to handle in a fight. <br>Farley whispered, "He's got a six-shooter in his boot. Get set. It's liable to be a hell of a scrap." <br>Farley waited until Leach opened the gate for the cow to enter the lot. He stepped out into the open and said, "Hands up. We're Rangers." He shoved a pistol forward, almost in Leach's face. <br>Leach wilted and raised trembling hands. "Don't shoot. For God's sake, Ranger, don't shoot." <br>Farley seemed let down by the lack of resistance. "You're harborin' a fugitive. We got a warrant for Joseph Bransford's arrest." <br>"Go help yourself," Leach said in a quavering voice. "He's in the cabin. Only please don't shoot. I'm a married man. My wife depends on me." <br>Disgusted, Farley told Andy, "Cuff this cowardly son of a bitch to the fence post." He turned back to Leach, waving the pistol in his face. "If you holler I'll blow a hole in your brisket." <br>Fear gave Leach's voice a high pitch. "I won't make a peep." <br>Andy said, "That was easy." <br>Farley did not hide his disappointment. "Bransford is apt to come at us like a mad bull. Be ready to shoot him." <br>"What about the woman?" <br>"Don't worry none about her. She'll wilt like bluebonnets in June." <br>A wagon stood in front of the cabin. Farley placed himself behind it. He motioned for Andy to take cover behind a dug well ringed by a circular rock structure about three feet high, with windlass and wooden bucket on top. <br>Andy thought it would be more effective to burst into the cabin and take Bransford by surprise, giving him no time to put up resistance. But Farley preferred confrontation in broad daylight, where he could see his target and have plenty of room to move around. <br>Farley shouted, "Joseph Bransford, listen to me. We're the Rangers. There's ten of us, and we've got this cabin surrounded. Come out with your hands up or we'll burn the place and roast you like a pig." <br>Andy heard a woman's angry shout from inside. <br>For emphasis Farley fired a shot that showered splinters from the upper part of the door. He called, "Let the woman come out first. We got no paper on her." <br>The woman came out waving a heavy chunk of firewood. She made straight for Farley, cursing him for twelve kinds of egg-sucking dog. She was tall and broad and looked as if she could wrestle a mule to its knees. As Farley raised his arms for defense, she struck him twice. ...</p><h2>Cherry Pies &amp; Deadly Lies (A Very Cherry Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Crime with a Slice of Cherry Pie</strong></p> <p>Cherry enthusiast Whitney Bloom is furiously baking her way into the heart of Chicago with her fabulous cherry pies when she receives a desperate call from her mother.

It is the timeless story of an impoverished young girl, Elnora Comstock, growing up on the edge of the Limberlost swamp, and in order to pay for her education, she collects moths.Because Gene Stratton-Porter cares for the truth that is in her, she is the most widely read and most widely loved author in America today, with the probable exception of Harold Bell Wright. She is absolutely sincere in all her work, she is in dead earnest, she does not care primarily for money, but for certain ideas and ideals. Let no one underestimate the tremendous power that is hers because of these things, let no one underestimate her hold upon millions of readers; let none undervalue the influence she has exerted and continues to exert, an influence always for good, for clean living, for manly men, for womanly women, for love of nature, for sane and reasonable human hopes and aspirations, for honest affection, for wholesome laughter, for a healthy emotionalism as the basis and justification of humble and invaluable lives. If Mrs. Porter has egoism it is the sort of egoism that the world needs. It is nothing more or less than a firm and sustaining belief in one&#39;s self, in the worth of one&#39;s work, and is bred of a passionate conviction that you must always give the best of yourself without stint. Is it egoistical to believe that? Is it self-centeredness to be proud of that? Is it wrong, having set the world the best example of which you are capable, to call it to the world&#39;s attention? You will not get the present reporter to say so! You will get from him nothing but an expression of his own conviction that while literature, aesthetically viewed, may not have been enriched by Mrs. Porter&#39;s writings, thousands, yes, tens of thousands of men and women have been made happier and better by her stories. And that just about sweeps any other possible accomplishment into limbo! The secret of Mrs. Porter&#39;s success is sincerity, complete sincerity; doing one&#39;s best work and doing it to the top of one&#39;s bent. It is not a question of art. There is no art about it. The finest literary artist in the world could not duplicate her performance unless he were a duplicate of her. It&#39;s not a literary matter at all; the thing has its roots in the personality, in the mind and heart and nervous organization of the writer.

When he lands on Earth - in Kentucky, disguised as a human - it&#39;s with the intention of saving his own people from extinction. Newton patents some very advanced Anthean technology, which he uses to amass a fortune. He begins to build a spaceship to help the last 300 Antheans migrate to Earth. Meanwhile, Nathan Bryce, a chemistry professor in Iowa, is intrigued by some of the new products Newton&#39;s company brings to the market, and already suspects Newton of being an alien. As Bryce and the FBI close in, Newton finds his own clarity and sense of purpose diminishing.</p><p>T.J. Newton is an extraterrestrial who goes to Earth on a desperate mission of mercy. But instead of aid, Newton discovers loneliness and despair that ultimately ends in tragedy.Walter Tevis (1928-1984) was an American novelist and short-story writer.

Philip Roth's chronically tormented alter ego Nathan Zuckerman has just moved there, in "Smart Money." West Side? Isaac Bashevis Singer's narrator mingles with the customers in "The Cafeteria" (who debate politics and culture in four or five different languages) and becomes embroiled in an obsessional romance. And downtown, John Updike's Maples have begun their courtship of marital disaster, in "Snowing in Greenwich Village." John Cheever, John O'Hara, Lorrie Moore, Irwin Shaw, Woody Allen, Laurie Colwin, Saul Bellow, J. D. Salinger, Jean Stafford, Vladimir Nabokov--they and many other stellar literary guides to the city will be found in these pages.<br><br><b>Wonderful Town</b> touches on some of the city's famous places and stops at some of its more obscure corners, but the real guidebook in and between its lines is to the hearts and the minds of those who populate the metropolis built by its pages. Like all good fiction, these stories take particular places, particular people, and particular events and turn them into dramas of universal enlightenment and emotional impact. The five boroughs are the five continents. New York is every great and ordinary place. Each life in it, and each life in Wonderful Town, is the life of us all.</p><p>"Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm'd Manhattan?" marveled the excitable Walt Whitman in 1865. The skinny island and its four sister boroughs have continued to fascinate writers ever since, and it would be hard to find a better record of that fascination than <i>Wonderful Town: New York Stories from The New Yorker</i>. As David Remnick explains in his foreword, the fledgling magazine paid relatively little heed to the nuts and bolts of metropolitan life, and in his original prospectus, Harold Ross didn't even mention fiction. But in the following decades, Ross and his successors published so many classic New York stories that the real challenge, according to Remnick, was whittling down the selection: "As there is barely enough room in this city to contain all of its busy, funny, angry, joyful, carping, and canny inhabitants, there was barely enough room to contain the wide range of stories we agreed upon."<p> So what made the grade? There are treasures from John Cheever ("The Five-Forty-Eight"), James Thurber ("The Catbird Seat"), Maeve Brennan ("I See You, Bianca"), Isaac Bashevis Singer ("The Cafeteria"), Jamaica Kincaid ("Poor Visitor"), and many others. The uptown neighborhoods appear to be more generously represented--a token, perhaps, of the magazine's well-heeled, fur-bearing readership--but from early Updike to middle-period Tama Janowitz, there are plenty of excursions south of Fourteenth Street. It's not, however, a simple matter of geography, but a kind of urban metaphysics at work. There are numerous and overlapping New Yorks represented in this collection: you'll find John Cheever's postwar paradise cheek-by-jowl with Ann Beattie's yuppie stomping ground. Then there's James Stevenson's vision of a flooded Gotham: </p><blockquote> We are on the roof now. I have no idea what time it is, but it is daylight. The lower buildings have been submerged, the tall office buildings stand like tombstones above the heaving waves. There are whitecaps toward Central Park. An ocean liner stood by the Pan Am building for a while, then moved out to sea.... The water is swirling around the skylights now. The wind shifts. The waves are coming straight in from the Atlantic. </blockquote> Even in this postapocalyptic setting, New York stubbornly remains itself. A wonderful town indeed--and a wonderful collection to celebrate it. <i>--Anita Urquhart</i><br><b>Goings On About Town</b><br><br>"Sally and Lueger walked slowly down Twelfth Street. Lueger had his arm around Sally's waist. 'That was a very fine film tonight,' he was saying. 'I enjoy Deanna Durbin. Very young, fresh, sweet.

Instead, they spend their lives essentially disconnected from others, rushing through life content with brief visits and casual conversations. But what if one were to develop a community, a spiritual community, of people who walked with and supported each other through life's journey? A community of real friends who listened to each other's personal tragedies without merely trying to fix the problems, who encouraged and nurtured each other's strengths, and who accepted people for who they really are, instead of the image they try to portray. In <i>The Safest Place on Earth</i>, Larry Crabb explores such a place, where God can heal disconnected people and allow them to reconnect with each other and, ultimately, with Him.</p><p><b>Dr. Larry Crabb</b> is a well-known psychologist, seminar speaker, Bible teacher, author, and founder/director of NewWay Ministries.

Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. THE RED CARPET</b></p> <p>There are moments of great luxury in the life of a secret agent. There are assignments on which he is required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions when he takes refuge in good living to efface the memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory of an allied Secret Service.</p> <p>From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James Bond was treated like royalty.</p> <p>When he left the aircraft with the other passengers he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery. At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green rooms smelling of last year's air and stale sweat and guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of those closed doors marked PRIVATE that hide the careful men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p> <p>As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January wind he saw his own name going over the network: BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567, the short wait and the replies coming back on the different machines: NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE. And then, from the FBI: POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK. There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: FBI TO IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY, and the bland official out front would hand him back his passport with a 'Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other passengers through the wire fence towards the door marked US HEALTH SERVICE.</p> <p>In his case it was only a boring routine, of course, but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity that went on record in any file diminished his value and, ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America, where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends, of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p> <p>'Mr Bond?'</p> <p>A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health Service building.</p> <p>'My name's Halloran. Pleased to meet you!'</p> <p>They shook hands.</p> <p>'Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me, please?'</p> <p>He turned to the officer of the Airport police on guard at the door.</p> <p>'Okay, Sergeant.' 'Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.'</p> <p>The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran turned to the left, away from the building. Another policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary fence.</p> <p>'Bye, Mr Halloran.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Bye, Officer. Thanks.'</p> <p>Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond's two light suitcases were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn't imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from the mound of passengers' luggage he had seen only minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p> <p>'Okay, Grady. Let's go.'</p> <p>Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the Dynaflow gears.</p> <p>He turned to Halloran.</p> <p>'Well, that's certainly one of the reddest carpets I've ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through Immigration. Who laid it on? I'm not used to VIP treatment. Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.'</p> <p>'You're very welcome, Mr Bond.' Halloran smiled and offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies. 'We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you want, just say so and it's yours. You've got some good friends in Washington. I don't myself know why you're here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should be a privileged guest of the Government. It's my job to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably as possible and then I'll hand over and be on my way. May I have your passport a moment, please.'</p> <p>Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a briefcase on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal stamp. He turned the pages of Bond's passport until he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature over the dark blue circle of the Department of Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope which he gave to Bond.</p> <p>'There's a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.' He held up his hand as Bond started to speak. 'And it's Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski haul. We're using it back at them and you are asked to co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let's please say no more about it and,' he added, as Bond continued to hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, 'I am also to say that the disposal of this money through your hands has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.'</p> <p>Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put the envelope away in his notecase.</p> <p>'All right,' he said. 'And thanks. I'll try and spend it where it does most harm. I'm glad to have some working capital. It's certainly good to know it's been provided by the opposition.'</p> <p>'Fine,' said Halloran; 'and now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just write up my notes for the report I'll have to put in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation. Routine.'</p> <p>'Go ahead,' said Bond. He was glad to keep silent and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war. It was no waste of time to start picking up the American idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots; the exotic pungency of the road signs: SOFT SHOULDERS - SHARP CURVES - SQUEEZE AHEAD - SLIPPERY WHEN WET; the standard of driving; the number of women at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the men's clothes; the way the women were doing their hair; the Civil Defence warnings: IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK - KEEP MOVING - GET OFF BRIDGE; the thick rash of television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public appeals for cancer and polio funds: THE MARCH OF DIMES - all the small, fleeting impressions that were as important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs to the trapper in the jungle.</p> <p>The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York hastening towards them until they were down amongst the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the stressed-concrete jungle.</p> <p>Bond turned to his companion.</p> <p>'I hate to say it,' he said, 'but this must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.'</p> <p>'Nothing to touch it,' agreed Halloran. 'Keeps me awake nights thinking what would happen.'</p> <p>They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire. On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p> <p>'Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.' He was deferential. 'Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?'</p> <p>'Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has everything he wants.'</p> <p>Bond turned to say good-bye to Halloran and thank him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as he said something about Bond's luggage to the commissionaire. Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared north up Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel, a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur's uniform, and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse of the single passenger - a huge grey-black face which had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated towards the Avenue.</p> <p>Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched his elbow impatiently.</p> <p>'We'll go straight in and through the lobby to the elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car was from.</p> <p>And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black face? Mister Big?</p> <p>'Hm,' said Bond to himself as he followed the slim back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p> <p>The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p> <p>'We've got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,' said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much enthusiasm.</p> <p>They walked down the corridor to the corner room.</p> <p>The wind sighed outside the passage windows and Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central Park. He felt far out of touch with the ground and for a moment a strange feeling of loneliness and empty space gripped his heart.</p> <p>Dexter unlocked the door of No. 2100 and shut it behind them.

Sexing the Cherry is an imaginative tour de force exploring history, imagination, and the nature of time. In a fantastic world that is and is not seventeenth-century England, a baby is found floating in the Thames. The child is rescued by the Dog Woman, a murderous gentle giant who names her newfound trophy Jordan and takes him out for walks on a leash. When he grows up Jordan, like Gulliver, travels the world, but finds that the strangest wonders are spun out of his own head. The strangest wonder of all is Time. Does it exist? What is its nature? Why does every journey conceal another journey within its lines? What is the difference between seventeenth-century Jordan and twentieth-century Nicholas Jordan, a navel cadet in a warship? And who are the Twelve Dancing Princesses? With a story full of shimmering epiphanies, Jeanette Winterson again demonstrates the keenness of her craft and the singularity of her vision. <p>"Sexing the Cherry fuses history, fairy tale, and metafiction into a fruit . . . of a memorably startling flavor." -The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"The marvelous and the horrific, the mythic and the mundane overlap and intermingle in this wonderfully inventive novel."-The New York Times </p><p>"Sexing the Cherry is a dangerous jewel . . . a mixture of The Arabian Nights touched by the philosophical form of Milan Kundera and told with the grace of Italo Calvino."-San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"Sexing the Cherry is a firecracker. . . .

The trade paperback has three new chapters, an expanded photo-document section, and updated text throughout, including the completed story of how three powerful Mafia bosses used John and Robert Kennedy&#x2019;s top-secret plan of staging a coup against Fidel Castro to murder JFK. Documented from the National Archives for the first time is Watergate burglar Bernard Barker's decades-long work for the Mafia, even Barker&#x2019;s time aiding the CIA with the coup plan. Barker sold out the coup plan to his mob bosses helping to assassinate JFK, and forcing US officials previously involved with Barker to withhold key information from the Warren Commission. This cloud of secrecy surrounding JFK&#x2019;s assassination allowed two men who confessed to playing roles in JFK's murder to be free and aid in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King in 1968.

The foothills village of Lugo Vicentino overlooks the Astico River, whose broad valley must have been pretty once but is now an unsettled quilt of cultivated fields and large manufacturing sheds. The mixture of agriculture and industry is apparent in the La Casara restaurant, where I'm surrounded by a noisy crowd of farmers and factory workers enjoying their lunch hour. </p><p> After an excessive meal, which raises again the puzzle of how Italians get anything done in the afternoon, I take a stroll. The restaurant is on the outskirts of the village. The houses here are too new to be picturesque, but the neat buildings and well-kept gardens attest to the prosperity of the region. The suburban landscape is dotted with agricultural remnants: a renovated farmhouse, a stone barn, a fenced piece of pasture. At the edge of the built-up area the ground rises steeply and I can see the bare branches of an orchard. Farther up the hill, behind a forsythia hedge that is already blooming, a large rectangular building with a red-tile roof commands the scene. This is what I've come to see -- Palladio's Villa Godi. Although Renaissance country houses are commonly referred to as villas, this use of the term is modern. In the sixteenth century, <i>la villa</i> referred to the entire estate; the house itself was <i>la casa padronale</i> (the master's house), or more simply <i>la casa di villa.</i> </p><p> I drive my rented car up the winding road. "Placed on a hill with a wonderful view and beside a river" is how Palladio described the house, and despite its industrial excrescence the Astico valley still presents a spectacular vista. The house sits on a man-made podium circumscribed by an imposing stone retaining wall. The curving, battered wall resembles a medieval bastion; the sturdy building, with its compact mass and severe symmetry, likewise has a military bearing. At first glance it could be an armory or a garrison post. As one gets closer, two features soften its severity: the plastered walls, which are painted a faded but cheerful buttery yellow and resemble old parchment, and an arcaded loggia, which is recessed into the center of the building and creates a shaded and welcoming entrance. </p><p> The caretaker lets me in through a large wrought-iron gate and I follow a path across the podium. The gravel crunches agreeably underfoot. The lawn is planted with conifers clipped into spheres and pyramids. A fountain, whose centerpiece is a statue of a nymph surrounded by cavorting cherubs, sprays water into a pool. I give her a sideward glance and hurry through the garden to the house. </p><p> The villa, which did not look large from a distance, turns out to be immense, almost as tall as a modern five-story building. The plain plastered walls are relieved by a regular pattern of windows with stone frames and slightly different details: a heavy bracketed sill for the lowest floor; a delicately modeled sill for the main level; and a plain surround for the attic. Square windows are pushed up against an elegant cornice just under the shallow eaves. The cornice is supported by a row of little repetitive blocks, a detail adapted from ancient Roman temple eaves decorations called modillions. These are the only classical references in this otherwise undecorated and austere fa�ade. </p><p> "The master's rooms, which have floors thirteen feet above ground, are provided with ceilings," Palladio wrote, "above these are the granaries, and in the thirteen-foot-high basement are placed the cellars, the places for making wine, the kitchen, and other similar rooms." This pragmatic stacking of warehouse and domestic uses originated in Venice, where land was scarce. The tall Godi "basement" is entirely aboveground, so a long straight stair leads to the loggia. This spacious outdoor room faces west, which must give splendid views of sunsets over the peaks of the <i>altipiano</i> but leaves the main fa�ade of the house exposed to the hot afternoon sun. It is unclear why Palladio turned the building this way -- the preferred orientation was southern, and that view was equally fine. It may have had to do with how one originally arrived at the villa, since old maps show a long, straight approach road climbing the hill from the west. Or it may be explained by the fact that the villa is believed to incorporate parts of a medieval house that already existed on the site. The citizens of the Venetian Republic had a reputation for penny-pinching, if not outright parsimony, and new houses were frequently built on top of old ones in order to save money by reusing foundations and walls. </p><p> The <i>intonaco,</i> or plastered stucco, of the walls shows marks where it was once incised to simulate the joints of stone construction. The entry in my old edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> claims that Palladio's buildings were originally "designed to be executed in stone." In fact, none of Palladio's country houses are built of stone; all are brick covered in plaster, which was the standard method of construction for rural buildings. The jointing pattern, which is faint today but was prominent when the house was built, was not meant to deceive. Like the wooden faux-stonework of George Washington's Mount Vernon, it produces a sense of scale as well as a pleasing decorative texture. </p><p> Not all the masonry is simulated. The most distinctive feature of the house is the three-arch loggia whose square piers, arches, and imposts from which the arches spring are all faced with stone. Two carved stone emblems adorn the wall above the loggia: an armorial shield with imperial eagles, symbols of the owner's nobility, and a rampant lion, the <i>stemma,</i> or coat of arms, of the Godi family. An inscription on the tablet below reads HIERONYMUS GODUS HENRICI ANTONII FILIUS FECIT ANNO MDXLII (Built by Girolamo Godi, son of Enrico Antonio, in the year 1542). The Godis, one of the most powerful and wealthy patrician families of Vicenza, owned large estates in the Vicentino. When the patriarch Enrico Antonio died in 1536, he bequeathed the lands in common to his three sons (the fourth was a priest). Girolamo took charge of the Lugo holdings, more than five hundred acres, which included the hilltop of Lonedo, where he started to build a villa the following year. </p><p> Small doors lead directly from the loggia to rooms on either side, but the large door in the center is obviously the main entrance. PROCUL ESTE PROFANI is carved into the stone frame. "Keep the unholy far away" may have been intended tongue in cheek, since the Godis were known to have had heretical tendencies. ET LIBERA NOS A MALO -- "And deliver us from evil" -- completes the sentiment on the inside. I read the interior inscription later, for when I open the door my attention is immediately arrested by the grand space -- as Palladio, no doubt, intended. The cavernous room rises up to the roof -- about twenty-five feet -- and extends all the way to the rear of the house. This is the <i>sala,</i> or hall. The <i>sala,</i> which originated in medieval times, was a common feature of Venetian country houses. Always the largest room in the house, it was neither an entrance vestibule nor a living room, but a formal social space, "designed for parties, banquets, as the sets for acting out comedies, weddings, and similar entertainments," Palladio wrote. The <i>sala</i> in the Villa Godi is lit by a large window, a triple opening with a semicircular arch in the center called a <i>serliana.</i> This end of the <i>sala</i> extends slightly beyond the rest of the house, and the additional narrow windows on the two sides give the effect of a large bay window, which not only illuminates the room but also affords views of the garden below. </p><p> The <i>sala</i> is flanked by eight large rooms -- four on each side. Six of the rooms are identical, two are slightly smaller to make room for the staircases; the large rooms are each about eighteen by twenty-eight feet. This seems like a lot of space, but the bachelor Girolamo shared the villa with his brothers and their families. There are no corridors; instead, each room opens directly into the next. The doors and windows are exactly lined up so that standing in one of the rooms with my back to a window, I can look through four sets of open doors and see the corresponding window on the opposite side of the house. The stair, the loggia arcade, the front door, the <i>sala,</i> and the <i>serliana</i> are likewise carefully aligned. These precise geometrical relationships give the interior a sense of calm and repose. Everything appears in its place. </p><p> I walk around the house, or rather slide since I am obliged to wear felt slippers to reduce wear on the floors. These are <i>battuto,</i> an early version of terrazzo, made by slathering a mixture of lime, sand, and powdered brick across the floor, pressing milled stone chips into the hardening mixture with heavy rollers, then grinding smooth and oiling the surface. There are no other visitors, and the caretaker has left me alone. I swish from room to room. The doorways are low and the unpretentious doors of simple plank construction have wrought-iron strap hinges. The identical windows incorporate a charming feature: facing stone seats that transform them into little conversation nooks. The flat ceilings are supported by closely spaced wooden beams with ornamental carvings on the underside. The only room with a plaster ceiling is in the southeast corner of the house, a privileged position that gets the morning sun, summer and winter, and probably belonged to Girolamo. </p><p> The Godi house, which was begun about 1537, has the distinction of being Palladio's first villa; indeed, as far as we know, it was his first independent commission. The novice had moments of clumsiness, particularly in the front fa�ade. The recessed entrance bay, for example, while welcoming, has a large section of blank wall over the loggia, which the heraldic coats of arms do not quite fill. The external staircase rises to a complicated landing in front of the loggia that distracts from the overall composition. The asymmetrical placement of the windows on the fa�ade is disturbing. Instead of being equally spaced they are bunched together in pairs (to leave space for the fireplaces and chimneys, which are located on the exterior walls). Thirty years later, when Palladio was writing his architectural treatise, he included drawings of the Villa Godi but took the opportunity to smooth out these defects. Leaving the plan largely unaltered, he simplified the stair, reduced the number of windows and spaced them equally, and capped the central section of the house with a pediment. </p><p> The design of the villa is very successful in one key respect. Earlier Venetian villas often look like town houses transposed to the country, elegant but slightly ill at ease. Palladio manages to make the Godi both a polished work of architecture and a sturdy farmhouse. Like a country gentleman in a tailored hacking coat and muddy rubber boots, the villa fits into its surroundings, even as it holds itself above them. This quality would permeate all of Palladio's villas, which are both sophisticated and rustic, genteel and rude, cosmopolitan and vernacular. </p><p> The Villa Godi hasn't always been appreciated. Sir Charles Barry, the leading British architect of the early 1800s, thought it "an unarchitectural pile." Banister Fletcher, the nineteenth-century author of a long-lived architectural history, a bulky copy of which I owned as a student, considered the Godi's main fa�ade "a very poor example of our master's genius." The modern art historian Rudolf Wittkower criticized the Villa Godi as "retrogressive." Indeed, as Wittkower pointed out, the design bears a resemblance to the Villa Tiretta, a country house built about forty years earlier near the village of Arcade, only thirty miles away. In fact, the proportions of Godi are more robust than Tiretta, and the massing is much more accomplished. But the resemblance is a reminder that Palladio, at this early stage of his career, was not straying far from established local traditions. His conservatism is understandable. Most architects today begin their careers designing kitchen additions or weekend cottages. The Godi is a palatial residence on a dramatic site, for the richest family in town. A mistake here could stop one's career in its tracks; it is prudent to be cautious. </p><p> An architect's early work is often consigned to a back drawer. Some masters, such as Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, even suppressed their youthful efforts. Yet when the elderly Palladio was being interviewed by the painter and architect Giorgio Vasari, who was collecting material for <i>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects,</i> he specifically mentioned the Villa Godi. And he included a description of the villa in his great treatise, <i>I quattro libri dell'architettura</i> (The four books on architecture), which he published near the end of his life. He may have made some mistakes and not broken new ground at the Villa Godi, but he was obviously proud of his first building. It couldn't have been an easy commission: a no-doubt demanding client used to getting his own way; an exceptionally large house; a dramatic site with a splendid view, but also perched on a slope and restricted in area; and existing buildings that had to be integrated into the design. Yet the novice pulled it all together and produced a handsome work of great gravitas and, yes, nobility. It is an exceptional accomplishment for a beginner. </p><p> A beginner in architecture but no stripling, for when Palladio was first mentioned as working on the Godi house he was already thirty-two years old. Renaissance architectural careers started late: Filippo Brunelleschi was forty-one when he entered the competition to design the dome of the cathedral in Florence; the great Donato Bramante was thirty-seven when he was called to rebuild St. Peter's in Rome; Vasari was forty when he designed his first building; and Michelangelo was forty-six before he applied his prodigious talent to architecture. Since there were no architects' guilds or associations in the sixteenth century, there was no period of formal training or apprenticeship. In that sense, to be an architect did not mean to be a professional; it meant, rather, to hold a position. Renaissance architects were generally mature men who had already distinguished themselves in some branch of the fine arts. Brunelleschi was a renowned goldsmith and clockmaker; Bramante and Vasari were accomplished painters; Michelangelo was a celebrated sculptor as well as a painter. Palladio stands out in this company, for when he entered architecture he was not famous nor did he have a background in the arts -- he was a stonemason. </p><p> He was born in Padua in 1508, sixteen years after Columbus discovered America. It was November 30, St. Andrew's Day -- or so legend has it -- and the child was named Andrea. His father was either a miller or a maker of millstones, but in any case someone who delivered his products by boat, for he was called Pietro dalla Gondola; his mother was Marta, of whom little is known except that she was lame.

Douglas, on the other hand, was an extremely ignorant non-zoologist to whom everything that happened would come as a complete surprise, the biggest of which was that they actually found one. Douglas was absolutely riveted by this experience and decided he wanted more of it. Three years later, he and Mark set off on a further six expeditions - to Mauritius to find the world&#39;s rarest fruitbat and a mad Welshman; to Zaire to find man&#39;s closest living relatives, the gorillas; to Indonesia to find the man-eating dragons of Komodo; to China to find a blind dolphin; and to New Zealand to find the world&#39;s fattest and least aerodynamic parrot, the kakapo. The resulting book tells the story of the animals they found, but also of the journeys they made to find them, the people they met and the difficulties they overcame.</p><p>"Very funny and moving...The glimpses of rare fauna seem to have enlarged [Adams'] thinking, enlivened his world; and so might the animals do for us all, if we were to help them live."<br>THE WASHINGTON POST BOOK WORLD<br>Join bestselling author Douglas Adams and zooligist Mark Carwardine as they take off around the world in search of exotic, endangered creatures.

Sledge&#x2019;s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation.<br><br> An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B. Sledge became part of the war&#x2019;s famous 1st Marine Division&#x2014;3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where &#x201c;the world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.&#x201d; By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic.<br><br> Based on notes Sledge secretly kept in a copy of the New Testament, <i>With the Old Breed</i> captures with utter simplicity and searing honesty the experience of a soldier in the fierce Pacific Theater. Here is what saved, threatened, and changed his life.

This is the real deal, the real war: unvarnished, brutal, without a shred of sentimentality or false patriotism, a profound primer on what it actually was like to be in that war. It is a classic that will outlive all the armchair generals&#x2019; safe accounts of&#x2014;not the &#x2018;good war&#x2019;&#x2014;but the worst war ever.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ken Burns</b></p><p><b>E. B. &#x201c;Sledgehammer&#x201d; Sledge</b> was born and grew up in Mobile. In late 1943 he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. After basic training, he was sent to the Pacific Theater where he fought at Peleliu and Okinawa, two of the fiercest battles of World War II. Following the Japanese surrender, Sledge served in China as part of the occupation force. Upon his return home, he obtained a Ph.D. in biology and joined the faculty of Alabama College (later the University of Montevallo), where he taught until retirement. Sledge initially wrote about his war experiences to explain them to his family, but he was persuaded by his wife to seek publication. Sledge died on March 3, 2001.<i>Chapter One<br>Making of a Marine<br></i><br>I enlisted in the Marine Corps on 3 December 1942 at Marion, Alabama. At the time I was a freshman at Marion<br>Military Institute. My parents and brother Edward had urged<br>me to stay in college as long as possible in order to qualify for<br>a commission in some technical branch of the U.S. Army.<br>But, prompted by a deep feeling of uneasiness that the war<br>might end before I could get overseas into combat, I wanted<br>to enlist in the Marine Corps as soon as possible. Ed, a<br>Citadel graduate and a second lieutenant in the army, suggested<br>life would be more beautiful for me as an officer.<br><br>Mother and Father were mildly distraught at the thought of<br>me in the Marines as an enlisted man&#x2013;that is, &#x201c;cannon fodder.&#x201d;<br>So when a Marine recruiting team came to Marion Institute,<br>I compromised and signed up for one of the Corps&#x2019; new<br>officer training programs. It was called V-12.<br><br>The recruiting sergeant wore dress blue trousers, a khaki<br>shirt, necktie, and white barracks hat. His shoes had a shine<br>the likes of which I&#x2019;d never seen. He asked me lots of questions<br>and filled out numerous official papers. When he asked,<br>&#x201c;Any scars, birthmarks, or other unusual features?&#x201d; I described<br>an inch-long scar on my right knee. I asked why such<br>a question. He replied, &#x201c;So they can identify you on some Pacific<br>beach after the Japs blast off your dog tags.&#x201d; This was<br>my introduction to the stark realism that characterized the<br>Marine Corps I later came to know.<br><br>The college year ended the last week of May 1943. I had<br>the month of June at home in Mobile before I had to report 1<br>July for duty at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.<br><br>I enjoyed the train trip from Mobile to Atlanta because the<br>train had a steam engine. The smoke smelled good, and the<br>whistle added a plaintive note reminiscent of an unhurried<br>life. The porters were impressed and most solicitous when I<br>told them, with no little pride, that I was on my way to becoming<br>a Marine. My official Marine Corps meal ticket got me a<br>large, delicious shrimp salad in the dining car and the admiring<br>glances of the steward in attendance.<br><br>On my arrival in Atlanta, a taxi deposited me at Georgia<br>Tech, where the 180-man Marine detachment lived in Harrison<br>Dormitory. Recruits were scheduled to attend classes<br>year round (in my case, about two years), graduate, and then<br>go to the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, for officers&#x2019;<br>training.<br><br>A Marine regular, Capt. Donald Payzant, was in charge.<br>He had served with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal.<br>Seeming to glory in his duty and his job as our commander,<br>he loved the Corps and was salty and full of swagger. Looking<br>back, I realize now that he had survived the meat grinder<br>of combat and was simply glad to be in one piece with the<br>good fortune of being stationed at a peaceful college campus.<br>Life at Georgia Tech was easy and comfortable. In short,<br>we didn&#x2019;t know there was a war going on. Most of the college<br>courses were dull and uninspiring. Many of the professors<br>openly resented our presence. It was all but impossible to<br>concentrate on academics. Most of us felt we had joined the<br>Marines to fight, but here we were college boys again. The<br>situation was more than many of us could stand. At the end of<br>the first semester, ninety of us&#x2013;half of the detachment&#x2013;<br>flunked out of school so we could go into the Corps as enlisted<br>men.<br><br>When the navy officer in charge of academic affairs called<br>me in to question me about my poor academic performance, I<br>told him I hadn&#x2019;t joined the Marine Corps to sit out the war in<br>college. He was sympathetic to the point of being fatherly<br>and said he would feel the same way if he were in my place.<br>Captain Payzant gave the ninety of us a pep talk in front of<br>the dormitory the morning we were to board the train for boot<br>camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California.<br>He told us we were the best men and the best Marines in<br>the detachment. He said he admired our spirit for wanting to<br>get into the war. I think he was sincere.<br><br>After the pep talk, buses took us to the railway station. We<br>sang and cheered the whole way. We were on our way to war<br>at last. If we had only known what lay ahead of us!<br>Approximately two and a half years later, I came back<br>through the Atlanta railway station on my way home. Shortly<br>after I stepped off the car for a stroll, a young army infantryman<br>walked up to me and shook hands. He said he had noticed<br>my 1st Marine Division patch and the campaign ribbons<br>on my chest and wondered if I had fought at Peleliu. When I<br>said I had, he told me he just wanted to express his undying<br>admiration for men of the 1st Marine Division.<br><br>He had fought with the 81st Infantry Division (Wildcats),<br>which had come in to help us at Peleliu.* He was a machine<br>gunner, had been hit by Japanese fire on Bloody Nose Ridge,<br>and was abandoned by his army comrades. He knew he<br>would either die of his wounds or be cut up by the Japanese<br>when darkness fell. Risking their lives, some Marines had<br>moved in and carried him to safety. The soldier said he was so<br>impressed by the bravery, efficiency, and esprit of the<br>Marines he saw on Peleliu that he swore to thank every veteran<br>of the 1st Marine Division he ever ran across.<br>The &#x201c;Dago people&#x201d;&#x2013;as those of us bound for San Diego<br>were called&#x2013;boarded a troop train in a big railroad terminal<br>in Atlanta. Everyone was in high spirits, as though we were<br>headed for a picnic instead of boot camp&#x2013;and a war. The trip<br>across the country took several days and was uneventful but<br>interesting. Most of us had never been west, and we enjoyed<br>the scenery. The monotony of the trip was broken with card<br>games, playing jokes on each other, and waving, yelling, and<br>whistling at any and all women visible. We ate some meals in<br>dining cars on the train; but at certain places the train pulled<br>onto a siding, and we ate in the restaurant in the railroad terminal.<br>Nearly all of the rail traffic we passed was military. We saw<br>long trains composed almost entirely of flatcars loaded with<br>tanks, halftracks, artillery pieces, trucks, and other military<br>equipment. Many troop trains passed us going both ways.<br>Most of them carried army troops. This rail traffic impressed<br>on us the enormousness of the nation&#x2019;s war effort.<br><br>*Together with the 1st Marine Division, the U.S. Army&#x2019;s 81st Infantry Division<br>comprised the III Amphibious Corps commanded by Maj. Gen. Roy S.<br>Geiger, USMC. For the Palau operation, the 1st Marine Division assaulted<br>Peleliu on 15 September 1944 while the 81st Division took Angaur Island<br>and provided a regiment as corps reserve. The 81st Division relieved the 1st<br>Marine Division on Peleliu on 20 October and secured the island on 27 November.<br><br>We arrived in San Diego early one morning. Collecting our<br>gear, we fell into ranks outside our cars as a first sergeant<br>came along and told the NCOs on our train which buses to get<br>us aboard. This first sergeant looked old to us teenagers. Like<br>ourselves, he was dressed in a green wool Marine uniform,<br>but he had campaign ribbons on his chest. He also wore the<br>green French <i>fourrag�re </i>on his left shoulder. (Later, as a<br>member of the 5th Marine Regiment, I would wear the<br>braided cord around my left arm with pride.) But this man<br>sported, in addition, two single loops outside his arm. That<br>meant he had served with a regiment (either the 5th or 6th<br>Marines) that had received the award from France for distinguished<br>combat service in World War I.<br><br>The sergeant made a few brief remarks to us about the<br>tough training we faced. He seemed friendly and compassionate,<br>almost fatherly. His manner threw us into a false<br>sense of well-being and left us totally unprepared for the<br>shock that awaited us when we got off those buses.<br><br>&#x201c;Fall out, and board your assigned buses!&#x201d; ordered the first<br>sergeant.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people. Get aboard them buses!&#x201d; the NCOs<br>yelled. They seemed to have become more authoritarian as<br>we approached San Diego.<br><br>After a ride of only a few miles, the buses rolled to a stop in<br>the big Marine Corps Recruit Depot&#x2013;boot camp. As I<br>looked anxiously out the window, I saw many platoons of recruits<br>marching along the streets. Each drill instructor (DI)<br>bellowed his highly individual cadence. The recruits looked<br>as rigid as sardines in a can. I grew nervous at seeing how<br>serious&#x2013;or rather, scared&#x2013;they seemed.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people, off them damned buses!&#x201d;<br><br>We scrambled out, lined up with men from the other buses,<br>and were counted off into groups of about sixty. Several<br>trucks rolled by carrying work parties of men still in boot<br>camp or who had finished recently. All looked at us with<br>knowing grins and jeered, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be sorreee.&#x201d; This was the<br>standard, unofficial greeting extended to all recruits.<br><br>Shortly after we debused, a corporal walked over to my<br>group. He yelled, &#x201c;Patoon, teehut. Right hace, forwart huah.<br>Double time, huah.&#x201d;<br><br>He ran us up and down the streets for what seemed hours<br>and finally to a double line of huts that would house us for a<br>time. We were breathless. He didn&#x2019;t even seem to be breathing<br>hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Patoon halt, right hace!&#x201d; He put his hands on his hips and<br>looked us over contemptuously. &#x201c;You people are stupid,&#x201d; he<br>bellowed. From then on he tried to prove it every moment of<br>every day. &#x201c;My name is Corporal Doherty. I&#x2019;m your drill instructor.<br>This is Platoon 984. If any of you idiots think you<br>don&#x2019;t need to follow my orders, just step right out here and I&#x2019;ll<br>beat your ass right now. Your soul may belong to Jesus, but<br>your ass belongs to the Marines. You people are <i>recruits.<br></i>You&#x2019; re <i>not </i>Marines. You may not have what it takes to be<br>Marines.&#x201d;<br><br>No one dared move, hardly even to breathe. We were all<br>humbled, because there was no doubt the DI meant exactly<br>what he said.<br><br>Corporal Doherty wasn&#x2019;t a large man by any standard. He<br>stood about five feet ten inches, probably weighed around<br>160 pounds, and was muscular with a protruding chest and<br>flat stomach. He had thin lips, a ruddy complexion, and was<br>probably as Irish as his name. From his accent I judged him to<br>be a New Englander, maybe from Boston. His eyes were the<br>coldest, meanest green I ever saw. He glared at us like a wolf<br>whose first and foremost desire was to tear us limb from limb.<br>He gave me the impression that the only reason he didn&#x2019;t do<br>so was that the Marine Corps wanted to use us for cannon<br>fodder to absorb Japanese bullets and shrapnel so genuine<br>Marines could be spared to capture Japanese positions.<br>That Corporal Doherty was tough and hard as nails none of<br>us ever doubted. Most Marines recall how loudly their DIs<br>yelled at them, but Doherty didn&#x2019;t yell very loudly. Instead he<br>shouted in an icy, menacing manner that sent cold chills<br>through us. We believed that if he didn&#x2019;t scare us to death, the<br>Japs couldn&#x2019;t kill us. He was always immaculate, and his uniform<br>fitted him as if the finest tailor had made it for him. His<br>posture was erect, and his bearing reflected military precision.<br>The public pictures a DI wearing sergeant stripes. Doherty<br>commanded our respect and put such fear into us that he<br>couldn&#x2019;t have been more effective if he had had the six stripes<br>of a first sergeant instead of the two of a corporal. One fact<br>emerged immediately with stark clarity: this man would be<br>the master of our fates in the weeks to come.<br><br>Doherty rarely drilled us on the main parade ground, but<br>marched or double-timed us to an area near the beach of San<br>Diego Bay. There the deep, soft sand made walking exhausting,<br>just what he wanted. For hours on end, for days on end,<br>we drilled back and forth across the soft sand. My legs ached<br>terribly for the first few days, as did those of everyone else in<br>the platoon. I found that when I concentrated on a fold of the<br>collar or cap of the man in front of me or tried to count the<br>ships in the bay, my muscles didn&#x2019;t ache as badly. To drop out<br>of ranks because of tired legs was unthinkable. The standard<br>remedy for such shirking was to &#x201c;double-time in place to get<br>the legs in shape&#x201d;&#x2013;before being humiliated and berated in<br>front of the whole platoon by the DI. I preferred the pain to<br>the remedy.<br><br>Before heading back to the hut area at the end of each drill<br>session, Doherty would halt us, ask a man for his rifle, and<br>tell us he would demonstrate the proper technique for holding<br>the rifle while creeping and crawling. First, though, he would<br>place the butt of the rifle on the sand, release the weapon, and<br>let it drop, saying that anyone who did that would have a<br>miserable day of it. With so many men in the platoon, it was<br>uncanny how often he asked to use my rifle in this demonstration. Then, after demonstrating how to cradle the rifle, he ordered<br>us to creep and crawl. Naturally, the men in front<br>kicked sand onto the rifle of the one behind him. With this<br>and several other techniques, the DI made it necessary for us<br>to clean our rifles several times each day. But we learned<br>quickly and well an old Marine Corps truism, &#x201c;The rifle is a<br>Marine&#x2019;s best friend.&#x201d; We always treated it as just that.<br><br>During the first few days, Doherty once asked one of the<br>recruits a question about his rifle. In answering, the hapless<br>recruit referred to his rifle as &#x201c;my gun.&#x201d; The DI muttered<br>some instructions to him, and the recruit blushed. He began<br>trotting up and down in front of the huts holding his rifle in<br>one hand and his penis in the other, chanting, &#x201c;This is my rifle,&#x201d;<br>as he held up his M1, &#x201c;and this is my gun,&#x201d; as he moved<br>his other arm. &#x201c;This is for Japs,&#x201d; he again held aloft his M1;<br>&#x201c;and this is for fun,&#x201d; he held up his other arm. Needless to say,<br>none of us ever again used the word &#x201c;gun&#x201d; unless referring to<br>a shotgun, mortar, artillery piece, or naval gun.<br><br>A typical day in boot camp began with reveille at 0400<br>hours. We tumbled out of our sacks in the chilly dark and hurried<br>through shaves, dressing, and chow. The grueling day<br>ended with taps at 2200. At any time between taps and<br>reveille, however, the DI might break us out for rifle inspection,<br>close-order drill, or for a run around the parade ground<br>or over the sand by the bay. This seemingly cruel and senseless<br>harassment stood me in good stead later when I found<br>that war allowed sleep to no man, particularly the infantryman.<br>Combat guaranteed sleep of the permanent type only.<br>We moved to two or three different hut areas during the<br>first few weeks, each time on a moment&#x2019;s notice. The order<br>was &#x201c;Platoon 984, fall out on the double with rifles, full individual<br>equipment, and seabags with all gear properly stowed,<br>and prepare to move out in ten minutes.&#x201d; A mad scramble<br>would follow as men gathered up and packed their equipment.<br>Each man had one or two close buddies who pitched in<br>to help each other don packs and hoist heavy seabags onto<br>sagging shoulders. Several men from each hut would stay behind<br>to clean up the huts and surrounding area as the other<br>men of the platoon struggled under their heavy loads to the<br>new hut area.<br><br>Upon arrival at the new area, the platoon halted, received<br>hut assignments, fell out, and stowed gear.

These pages reveal his reflections as a hermit on the joys and dangers of a life of solitude in the woods.<br></p><p><b>Thomas Merton,</b> a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual of the twentieth century. His diaries, social commentary, and spiritual writings continue to be widely read thirty years after his untimely death in 1968.During the years 1964-65, Merton sought, and was finally given, permission to live alone in his hermitage at the Abbey of Gethsemani. These years were criticalhe had to balance commitment to the demands of the monastic community with the call to a more solitary lifeand the writing from that time is consequently charged with disappointments and uncertainties, as well as quiet reflection and humor. Merton's frustration with church complacency and the censorship of his ideas is evident, a factor that probably hindered publication of this journal until now. But he also records musings, dreams, the visits of special friends. A very personal piece of writing blending "heavenliness and anguish," wherein unfolds its special appeal. Carol J.

Pink has held various pastorates in the United States. He has been engaged in Bible conference work in the United States, Australia, and other countries and resided in Scotland up until the time of his death, July 15, 1952. Pink was the author of various books and booklets on Bible exposition, as well as the editor and publisher of a Bible study magazine, Studies in the Scriptures.'Don't waste your time reading Barth and Brunner. You will get nothing from them to aid you with preaching. Read Pink.' --<i><strong>D.

Upon arriving for her crowning ceremony in beautiful Otuam, she discovers the dire reality: there's no running water, no doctor, and no high school, and many of the village elders are stealing the town's funds. To make matters worse, her uncle (the late king) sits in a morgue awaiting a proper funeral in the royal palace, which is in ruins. The longer she waits to bury him, the more she risks incurring the wrath of her ancestors. Peggy's first two years as king of Otuam unfold in a way that is stranger than fiction. In the end, a deeply traditional African town has been uplifted by the ambitions of its headstrong, decidedly modern female king. And in changing Otuam, Peggy is herself transformed, from an ordinary secretary to the heart and hope of her community.</p><p><p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>King Peggy</i></strong> <br> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Children of Otuam</td> <td>Eleanor and King Peggy in Otuam</td> <td>King Peggy</td> </tr> </tbody></table>PEGGIELENE BARTELS was born in Ghana in 1953 and moved to Washington, DC, in her early twenties to work at Ghana's embassy.

Eugene Smith, Robert Capa, Ralph Morse, Nina Leen, Harry Benson, Philippe Halsman, and Joe McNally, whose work for LIFE in the aftermath of September 11 was in the finest tradition of the magazine. Each portfolio includes a short biography, offering an intimate look at the people behind the lens. <br> <br> Here are the defining moments of the 20th century, including MacArthur wading ashore by Mydans, Capa's D-Day landing at Omaha Beach and, of course, Eisenstaedt's sailor kissing the nurse. Here are the first pictures taken from inside the womb and the first taken from outer space. Here are powerful scenes from Tiananmen Square and from the American South during the Civil Rights movement.

There is Julius, the bright, inquisitive son of a Long Island domestic worker who has always wanted to be respected for more than just his athletic ability, and there is Dr. J, the cool, acrobatic showman whose flamboyant dunks sent him to the Hall of Fame and turned the act of jamming a basketball through a hoop into an art form. In many ways, Erving&#x2019;s life has been about the push and pull of Julius and The Doctor.</p><p></p><p>It is Dr. J who has stories to tell of the wild days and nights of the ABA in the 1970s, and of being the seminal figure who transformed basketball from an earthbound and rigid game into the creative, free-flowing aerial display it is today. He has a long list of signature plays - he&#x2019;s famous for winning the first dunk contest in 1976 with a jam on which he lifted off from the foul line, and he made a miraculous layup against the Lakers on which he soared behind the backboard before reaching back in to flip the ball in on the other side, with one hand. He inspired a generation of dunkers, including Michael Jordan, to express their improvisational talents.</p><p></p><p>But Julius wasn&#x2019;t always as graceful and in control as Dr. J. Erving had a pristine image throughout his career and early retirement, but he was far from a perfect man. Here he gives detailed accounts of some of the personal problems he faced -- or created -- behind the scenes, including the adulterous affair with sports writer Samantha Stephenson, which led to the birth of his daughter, professional tennis player Alexandra Stephenson. </p><p></p><p>Though his marriage survived that infidelity, the death of Erving&#x2019;s 20-year-old son Cory in 2000 in a tragic accident proved too much for the union to bear. Erving paints a raw, heartbreaking picture of the dissolution of his marriage, as his wife Turquoise began to blame him for his refusal to be paralyzed by grief for as long as she was. Their intense arguments came to a head when Erving stepped out of the shower one day to find his wife holding a lamp in one hand and a vase in the other, ready for a physical confrontation. &#x201c;I knew somebody was going to get hurt, and it wasn&#x2019;t going to be me,&#x201d; he says. He packed a suitcase and he and Turquoise never lived under the same roof again.</p><p></p><p>Erving&#x2019;s story is a tale of the nearly perfect player and the imperfect man, and how he has come to terms with both of them. It will appeal to readers on a sports level and on a human one. </p></p><p><p>With startling honesty and an unmistakable voice, Dr. J is a historic self-portrait of an American legend, Julius "The Doctor" Erving.</p><p>With his flights of improvisation around the basket and his towering afro, Julius Erving became one of the most charismatic (and revolutionary) players basketball has ever known. But while the public has long revered this cultural icon, few have ever known of the double life of Julius Erving. <em>Dr. J</em> traces the inner lives of the nearly perfect player and the imperfect man&#x2014;and how he has come to terms with both.</p><p>Julius Erving is one of the greatest professional basketball players of all time and an American icon.

He completed his MFA in Graduate Studies in Ceramics at Rhode Island School of Design in 1974. He has spent the majority of his career (1976-2001) as a full-time studio potter in Asheville, North Carolina. He served as the initial director of Odyssey Center for the Ceramic Arts in Asheville from 1994 to 1995 and as a university professor of art from 1999 to 2015. His work is included in the collections of Rhode Island School of Design; The Asheville Art Museum; The International Museum of Ceramics in Alfred, New York; The Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina; and Shirakawa Public Hall in Japan.For years, ceramics instruction was considered best accomplished in a studio environment, supplemented by tomes on various specialty techniques, such as glazes. And for years, publishers and authors followed that unwritten law, producing texts that acted as gallery showcases and reference handbooks. No longer. North Carolina ceramicist Davis has written one of the first step-by-step illustrated introductions to wheel-thrown pottery, highlighted by 11 projects ranging in complexity from a simple spoon vase to a double-walled bowl. Nor is his the sole technique portrayed; he invites other professionals to share the limelight. Each design includes notes on surface treatment and firing, possible problems and solutions, and a colorful gallery of similar ceramics from artists across the country. Prefatory chapters feature essential tools and materials, an overview of surface treatments, and a section on "beginning to throw." <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>The Knight and the Dove (Kensington Chronicles, Book 4)</h2><p>When Marigold, Lord Vincent&#39;s oldest daughter, learns that the lowly earl her younger sister was forced to marry when Marigold refused is now a duke, she vows to make trouble for both of them</p><p>Lori Wick is a multifaceted author of Christian fiction.

This amazing story of triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds has been filmed by Werner Herzog as both a documentary (<em>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</em>) and a motion picture (<em>Rescue Dawn,</em> starring Christian Bale), and now receives its book treatment from Bruce Henderson, who served with Dengler in Vietnam.</p><p>I grew up believing in heroes. For me, they were always pilots. I joined the U.S. Navy reserve while still in high school so I could go out to Alameda (Calif.) Naval Air Station for monthly drills and be around airplanes and pilots. After a restless year in college, I volunteered for two years of active duty. That is what brought me in June 1965 to the aircraft carrier <i>Ranger</i> (CVA-61). And while I was serving aboard ship as a weatherman -- taking observations, plotting maps, and launching weather balloons -- another pilot came into my life.<br> Things started off badly for <i>Ranger</i> pilot Ltjg. Dieter Dengler, however: shot down over Laos; a violent crash in the jungle; the wreckage of his plane found deep in enemy territory, but there was no sign of his whereabouts. For long months, we heard nothing of him. In 1966, off the steamy coast of North Vietnam, there were many pilots who went missing. Most did not return.<br> The fate of Dieter Dengler was to be different. In a surreal scene of brotherhood and celebration, he returned to <i>Ranger </i>six months after being shot down -- emaciated, ravaged with tropical illnesses but very much alive and joyous to be so. True, Dieter Dengler was but one lost pilot and hero found. Yet for his fellow fliers and shipmates, and for me personally, his story of unending optimism, innate courage, loyalty, and survival against overwhelming odds, remains our best and brightest memory of our generation's war.<p>In February 1966, Dieter Dengler was shot down over &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; Laos in territory controlled by Pathet Lao guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars. After his capture, the German-born Dengler proved to be no ordinary prisoner. Already a legend in the navy for his unique escape skills, which he had demonstrated during survival training in the California desert, he found himself caught in a desperate situation, imprisoned by the enemy and by the jungle itself. Dengler's heroic impulse was to free not only himself but also other POWs&#x2014;American, Thai, and Chinese&#x2014;some of whom had been held for years. In a surreal scene of brotherhood and celebration, Dengler, nearly six months after being shot down, returned to his ship in the Gulf of Tonkin&#x2014;emaciated and ravaged with tropical maladies, but alive and free.</p><p>Bruce Henderson served with Dengler aboard USS <em>Ranger</em>. In this gripping book, he tells the complete story for the first time, drawing on personal interviews with the intrepid pilot, his squadron mates, and his friends and family, as well as military archival materials&#x2014;some never before made public&#x2014;and letters and journals. Henderson's riveting account demonstrates why Dengler's story of unending optimism, innate courage, loyalty, and survival against overwhelming odds remains for his fellow flyers and shipmates the best and brightest memory of their generation's war.</p></p><h2>All That Remains: A Life in Death</h2><p>_________ &#39;Utterly gripping&#39; - The Guardian &#39;Fascinating&#39; - The Sunday Times &#39;Moving&#39; - Scotsman &#39;Engrossing&#39; - Financial Times __________ The incredible memoir from the Sunday Times Bestseller. Professor Sue Black breathes new life into the subject of death. Sue Black confronts death every day. As a Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology, she focuses on mortal remains in her lab, at burial sites, at scenes of violence, murder and criminal dismemberment, and when investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident or natural disaster. In All That Remains she reveals the many faces of death she has come to know, using key cases to explore how forensic science has developed, and examining what her life and work has taught her. Do we expect a book about death to be sad? Macabre? Sue&#39;s book is neither. There is tragedy, but there is also humour in stories as gripping as the best crime novel. Part memoir, part science, part meditation on death, her book is compassionate, surprisingly funny, and it will make you think about death in a new light. _________ &#39;One might expect [this book] to be a grim read but it absolutely isn&#39;t.

Her expertise has been crucial to many high-profile criminal cases, and in 1999 she was the lead anthropologist for the British Forensic Team&#39;s work in the war crimes investigations in Kosovo. She was one of the first forensic scientists to travel to Thailand following the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 to provide assistance in identifying the dead. Sue is a familiar face in the media where documentaries have been filmed about her work and she led the highly successful BBC 2 series - History Cold Case. In 2015 she moved many to tears with her stories on Desert Island Discs and more recently she stunned over 300,000 Outlander followers when she announced that Lord Lovat, Simon Fraser, was not residing in a coffin built for him at the Wardlaw Mausoleum. Sue was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2016 Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours for services to forensic anthropology.&#34;Dame Sue Black writes about life and death with great tenderness but no nonsense, with impeccable science lucidly explained, and with moral depths humanely navigated, so that we can all feel better about the path we must all inevitably follow.

They can be addicting. They are available almost anywhere you go and are appealing to people of all ages. They can eat up our time, cost us money, even kill our relationships. But it&#x2019;s not all bad! This book will show that rather than being a waste of time, video games can help us develop skills, make friends, succeed at work, form good habits, and be happy. Taking the time to learn what&#x2019;s happening in our heads as we play and shop allows us to approach games and gaming communities on our own terms and get more out of them.<br><br>With sales in the tens of billions of dollars each year, just about everybody is playing some kind of video game whether it's on a console, a computer, a web browser, or a phone. Much of the medium&#x2019;s success is built on careful (though sometimes unwitting) adherence to basic principles of psychology. This is something that&#x2019;s becoming even more important as games become more social, interactive, and sophisticated. This book offers something unique to the millions of people who play or design games: how to use an understanding of psychology to be a better part of their gaming communities, to avoid being manipulated when they shop and play, and to get the most enjoyment out of playing games. With examples from the games themselves, Jamie Madigan offers a fuller understanding of the impact of games on our psychology and the influence of psychology on our games.</p><p>Jamie Madigan, PhD, has become an expert on the psychology of video games and seeks to popularize understanding of how various aspects of psychology can be used to understand why games are made how they are and why their players behave as they do. Madigan has written extensively on the subject for various magazines, websites, blogs, and his own site at psychologyofgames.com. He has also consulted with game development companies and talked at conferences about how game developers can incorporate psychology principles into game design and how players can understand how it affects their play. Finally, he has appeared as an expert on the psychology of video games in dozens of print, radio, and web outlets such as The Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, BBC Radio 5, the BBC, The Guardian, and more. He is a lifelong gamer and lives in St. Louis, Missouri.This is a smart, thorough, and funny journey into the world of video games. Madigan, a psychologist, takes a scholarly approach, incorporating notable studies from the past, such as Philip Zimbardo&#x2019;s experiment of having subjects supposedly administer painful electric shocks, related here to the 'reduced social accountability' observed in online game play. He bolsters the scientific subject matter with humor and a personable and accessible tone, especially when sharing his own experience as a gamer. His theories about mental focus don&#x2019;t seem particularly specific to video games, but rather are relevant to most forms of electronic and social media. . . .This is also a considerately conceived discussion, with handy bullet points at the end of each chapter. Madigan&#x2019;s work . . . [is] enough to get the attention of intellectually curious gamers. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Psychologist Jamie Madigan covers a wide range of topics associated with game consumption, design, and development, yet he manages to address each in detail. In contrast to those primarily interested in the emotions of gaming, Madigan lets the data do the talking and provides reasoned, balanced commentary around the data based on his long experience as a game player, analyst, and consultant. He explores recent phenomena such as the success of free-to-play and in-app purchases, using commercial game examples to make the book both comprehensible and useful to nonplayers. He also treats topics such as cheating, pay to play, trolling, and the effects of video game violence, dealing with them in a refreshingly frank and open-minded way. The bibliography alone makes this book a useful resource for students and faculty in academic game programs. Each chapter concludes with a list of central points. Madigan makes an excellent case for the role of psychology in video games, not only as a means of improving games but also as an area in which human nature is on display in many forms and can be fruitfully observed and studied. A great book. <br><br>Summing Up: Essential. All readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>I love a book that has a great opening sentence. Getting Gamers opens with 'The history of video games started in a small Norwegian village during the 1680's when a precocious young fisherman names Billy 'SadPanda42' Jackson created Call of Duty 3 out of sticks and moxie.' That, my friends, is a great opening sentence. Not only can Madigan write a good opener, he gets better as he goes. He takes complex concepts such as 'deindividuation' or 'spacial presence' and make them easily understandable. More than just understandable, but relatable. Using examples from casual games to intensely committed game fans, he shows the influence that the psychology behind the games can exert. . . .As a teacher, these concepts are [fascinating to] me. . . .[I]t has a wealth of ideas and concepts that teachers and administrators should be embracing to change the landscape of education for the better.

If you took Psychology 101 in college you no doubt recognize at least a few of these terms, and if you followed that up with a mid level course in social psychology you may recognize most of them. Jamie Madigan defines and uses all of these terms, quite appropriately, in his delightful book, Getting Gamers.... If you are a video gamer, the book&#x2019;s insights may help you appreciate the games all the more; help you become more rational in your choices of games and manner of playing them; and make you less likely to fall for gimmicks designed to part you from your hard-earned, real-world money or trap you into game routines that are ultimately more tedious than fun.... If you are a student or would-be student of psychology, you will find here accurate, fun-to-read descriptions of basic psychological theories, principles, and research findings, along with their applications to video games. Although this is a serious, thoughtful, well-researched book, it is written in a refreshingly breezy, often humorous style. (<i>American Journal of Play</i>)<br><br>Jamie takes us as deep into the minds of gamers as is possible without a scalpel. It's a fascinating and essential read. (Nir Eyal, author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products)<br><br>Jamie Madigan&#x2019;s fascinating exploration of the psychology of gaming blends provocative research findings with lively anecdotes and witty prose. It is accessible, insightful, and a must-read for gamers and game designers. (Nick Yee, author of The Proteus Paradox: How Online Games and Virtual Worlds Change Us--And How They Don't)<br><br>Madigan repackages research from familiar names in behavioral psychology such as Dan Ariely, Drazen Prelec, Amos Tversky, and Daniel Kahneman, into delightful, yet thought-provoking anecdotes that seek to understand and explain how psychology affects the world of games. His easy-to-read style and liberally-sprinkled humorous asides makes what could have been a dry, academic tome into a page-turner. Whether you are a game developer or game player, you will likely come away second-guessing pretty much everything about how and why we play! (Dave Mark, President and Lead Designer, Intrinsic Algorithm)<br><br>For those interested in the interplay between the science of the mind and the science of game design, there is no better place to begin than with this book. (Mike Ambinder, PhD, Experimental Psychologist, Valve Corporation)<br><br>Jamie Madigan has put together something fun, engaging, and seriously interesting, and not just for people who love games, but for people who wonder why we can be so weird online or inside our social media. I guarantee you will come away from this book with not only a better understanding of human behavior, but with advice on how to apply the latest research in your own life and profession. Madigan exposes how game designers have solved so many of the behavioral problems we see in other domains, and what you learn about their process will no doubt be useful in yours. Madigan's lively, quirky approach to the topic is sure to provide fresh insights, even if you've read a psychology book or two. Whether it is exploring immersion, grinding, why we cheat, why we lob insults, or how freemium games subtly guide our hands toward our wallets, Madigan wonderfully explains in detail the deeper phenomena at play. (David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart and You Are Now Less Dumb and host of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast)<br><br>For years now, Jamie Madigan has served as the unofficial psychologist of the games industry.

Sarnoff was convinced that Armstrong&#x2019;s inventions had the power to change the way societies communicated with each other forever. He would become a visionary captain of the media industry, even predicting the advent of the Internet.</p><p>In the mid-1930s, however, when Armstrong suspected Sarnoff of orchestrating a cadre of government officials to seize control of the FM airwaves, he committed suicide. Sarnoff had a very different view of who his friend&#x2019;s enemies were.</p><p>Many corrupt politicians and corporations saw in Armstrong&#x2019;s inventions the opportunity to commodify our most ubiquitous natural resource&#x2014;the air. This early alliance between high tech and business set the precedent for countless legal and industrial battles over broadband and licensing bandwidth, many of which continue to influence policy and debate today.</p></p><p><p>The astonishing story of two friends&#x2014;one a media mogul, the other a famous inventor&#x2014;and their fight to control America&#x2019;s airwaves</p><p>For more than a century, monopolies have constricted control of the airwaves, funneling power into the hands of a select few. In <em>The Network</em>, investigative journalist Scott Woolley recounts one of the greatest business heists in American history&#x2014;the massive rip-off of the airwaves&#x2014;as it played out in a compelling drama between the technology&#x2019;s inventor, Edwin Armstrong; its primary purveyor, David Sarnoff, the head of RCA and NBC; and corrupt government regulators across the country. </p><p>Sarnoff and Armstrong were close friends and collaborators for decades, and together they oversaw the birth of radio and television. Optimists like Armstrong and Sarnoff believed that expanding the power of the airwaves would radically reduce the cost of connecting people and create new, giant industries. Many corrupt politicians and corporations, however, saw in Armstrong&#x2019;s inventions a threat to their power, and a reason to rig the rules in order to keep communications channels scarce and prices high. </p><p>With a singular eye for detail and knack for narrative, Woolley paints vivid portraits of Sarnoff&#x2019;s and Armstrong&#x2019;s trials and triumphs, and of the many supporting characters&#x2014;Guglielmo Marconi and Lyndon B. Johnson, among others&#x2014;who stood in Armstrong&#x2019;s and Sarnoff&#x2019;s way. Woolley expertly reveals how this early alliance between high tech and business set the stage for today&#x2019;s Internet and the fights over the future of global communications that continue to rage.</p><p>Masterfully weaving together the stories of these competing interests into a thrilling clash between progress and paralysis, innovation and stagnation, <em>The Network</em> tells the dramatic story of the friendship that drove a revolution in global communications and the powerful political and corporate interests that hijacked America&#x2019;s airwaves.&nbsp; </p><p>Praise For <em>The Network</em></p><p>&#x201c;Woolley interweaves an engrossing tale of the evolution of the American communications industry with colorful details about the individuals who built the tech, and the regulatory challenges that threatened to derail it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jonathan Zittrain, author of <em>The Future of the Internet&#x2014;And How to Stop It</em> </p><p>and Professor of Law and Professor of Computer Science, Harvard University</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Scott Woolley presents a lively and informative account of the stunningly successful collaborations and final bitter fight of David Sarnoff and Edwin Armstrong, two visionary leaders who played key roles in the evolution of the wireless industry. The interaction of personalities, technology, business, and government regulation are of great current relevance, as those same issues again dominate in the rise of new revolutionary services and products.&#x201d; &#x2014;Andrew Odlyzko, Bell Labs and University of Minnesota communications expert</p><p>&#x201c;Woolley packs a lot into this slim book.

Hoch (November 1, 1889 - May 31, 1978) was a German Dada artist. She is best known for her work of the Weimar period, when she was one of the originators of photomontage. H�ch was the lone woman among the Berlin Dada group, however she was dismayed to the Dadaists lip service to women&#39;s emancipation and her work echos her feelings that there were difference between women in media and reality. Marriage did not escape her criticism-she depicted brides as mannequins and children, reflecting the idea that women are not seen as complete people and have little control over their lives. A long-time German resident, her work fell out of favor after WWII although she continued to produce her photomontages and exhibit them internationally until her death in 1978. The Berlin Dadaists - the &#34;monteurs&#34; (mechanics) - would use scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press.</p><p></p><h2>God&#39;s Word in Human Words: An Evangelical Appropriation of Critical Biblical Scholarship</h2><p>The conclusions of critical biblical scholarship often pose a disconcerting challenge to traditional Christian faith. Between the two poles of uncritical embrace and outright rejection of these conclusions, is there a third way? Can evangelical believers incorporate the insights of biblical criticism while at the same time maintaining a high view of Scripture and a vital faith? In this provocative book, Kenton Sparks argues that the insights from historical and biblical criticism can indeed be valuable to evangelicals and may even yield solutions to difficult issues in biblical studies while avoiding pat answers. This constructive response to biblical criticism includes taking seriously both the divine and the human aspects of the Bible and acknowledging the diversity that exists in the biblical texts.</p><p>"Finally, a fresh, creative, carefully nuanced approach to biblical criticism from an evangelical! Sparks skillfully makes his case for a 'believing criticism' by carefully assessing the current available alternatives. His thorough, methodical work stakes out for many thoughtful evangelicals a credible, theologically based, devout place to stand in integrating critical work and faith. I highly recommend it."--<b>Robert L. Hubbard Jr.</b>, North Park Theological Seminary<br><br>"This important volume provides a bridge between critical scholarship and traditional views on Scripture. In the process of surveying the flash points created by modern critical scholarship, Sparks champions 'practical realism' as an approach that provides a more productive middle ground. Both evangelicals and nonevangelicals will benefit from this very frank discussion of the history and possible future for biblical scholarship."--<b>Victor H. Matthews</b>, Missouri State University<br><br>"Sparks issues an irenic invitation to reconcile academic consensus with evangelical conviction in ways that respect and inform both. His plea for his fellow evangelicals to take historical criticism much more seriously features impressive and honest arguments for mainstream critical stances toward Old and New Testament texts, informative tours of fields from hermeneutics to Assyriology to patristic and Reformation theology, and a bold proposal to affirm biblical inerrancy in terms of perfect divine accommodation to human error. May it encourage and shape the fruitful conversation we evangelicals absolutely need to have."--<b>Telford Work</b>, Westmont College<br><br>"Sparks asks hard questions. In this volume he provides answers that he believes satisfy intellectually as well as spiritually. His erudition is evident on every page. Of course, not all will agree with his version of 'practical realism' and how it relates to biblical hermeneutics, but few can deny that he has advanced the conversation in a way that is helpful and healthy."--<b>Bill T. Arnold</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary<br><br>"Sparks emphatically affirms both the methodology and results of historical and modern biblical criticism and the authority of Scripture. He distinguishes divine inerrancy from the finite and fallible human vessels through whom God chose to reveal God's Word. This is a valuable window into the 'progressive evangelical' approach to the nature of Scripture."--<b>Elaine A. Phillips</b>, Gordon College<b>Kenton L.

BUSH, LACROSSE, WISCONSIN, 18 OCTOBER, 2000<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Mel hired one of Da&#x2019;s nephews&#x2014;the slow-witted one with the dent in his forehead&#x2014;to sink a well in his back acre. The irrigation trenches his family had dug between the rows of oil palms didn&#x2019;t extend to the rear fence and the new fronds were browning even before they fanned open. It hadn&#x2019;t rained for a month. Mel had been lugging watering cans out there for two weeks and his back bones were starting to clack like mah-jong tiles. So, a well, a cheap Chinese pump, half a dozen sprinklers, and all he&#x2019;d need to do was flick a switch. Oil palms took care of themselves if you watered them often and gave them manure treats once every three months. Twenty palms saved without crippling his spine. Cheap at twice the price.<br>So, on Saturday last, Old Mel sat on the top rung of the back fence and watched the young man work. The nephew&#x2019;s skull indentation made Mel wonder if he&#x2019;d been hit by a metal petanque ball thrown at high speed. Such was the concavity. But he decided it was better not to ask. He knew the response would be long and slobbered. He knew the nephew would stop work to reply because he couldn&#x2019;t perform two functions simultaneously. So Mel merely sat and watched him dig. He could have chipped in with some labor to make the job easier but Old Mel was a firm believer in not hiring a goat and bleating himself.<br>The tried-and-tested southern Thai method of sinking a well would undoubtedly not have been acceptable in any Western country where concepts such as &#x201c;quality&#x201d; and &#x201c;safety standards&#x201d; were firmly in place. Four one-meter concrete pipe segments lay on the ground to one side. The nephew would dig a hole broad and deep enough to insert one of the segments. He would then jump into the hole and continue to burrow downward, scooping out earth from beneath the concrete pipe. The latter would sink into the ground like a very slow elevator. Once its top lip was level with the surface of the field, the second pipe segment would be placed on top of it and the excavation would continue. The earth in Old Mel&#x2019;s field was a mixture of dirt and sand and once you got below the knotty pissweed, it was not terribly hard to dig. The problems would begin&#x2014;if you were lucky&#x2014;when the third section was inserted and the water started to rise, turning the hole into a mudbath spa. Before the fourth segment was level with the ground, the unfortunate young man could be spending half his time submerged in murky brown water.<br>But on this arid Saturday morning the well would not allow itself to be sunk. At no more than waist depth below the surface, the nephew&#x2019;s hoe clanged against something solid. A loud metallic gong scattered the wimpy drongos from the trees. Lizards scampered from beneath rocks. The nephew was obviously enchanted by the percussion because he struck three more times before Mel could convince him to cease. The old man climbed down from his perch, hooked his toes into his sandals, and ambled over to the hole. He stopped at the concrete rim and stared down at his laborer&#x2019;s feet which, against all the odds, stood astride a small island of rust.<br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be much,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;Probably a barrel lid. Sink your hoe off to the edges. You can work your way below it and pry it up.&#x201d;<br>Easily said. The nephew prodded and poked but every foray produced the same tinny clunk. There was no way around it. For all anyone knew, the obstruction might have extended from the Gulf all the way across to the Andaman Sea and been connected to one of the earth&#x2019;s plates. All Mel could think about was that this sheet of metal stood defiantly between him and lower-back-pain relief. He wasn&#x2019;t about to give in without a fight whether it unbalanced the earth or not. He walked to the fence, grabbed a solid black crowbar and held it out to the lad.<br>&#x201c;Here, use this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Smash your way through it.&#x201d;<br>Da&#x2019;s nephew stared forlornly at the tool. It was obvious some laborious mechanical process was taking place in his mind. The crowbar was getting heavy in Mel&#x2019;s hand.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just paid for digging,&#x201d; said the nephew, at last. &#x201c;Nobody said nothing about smashing. That&#x2019;s a job for specialists, smashing is. I&#x2019;m just a digger.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go on, boy. Look at it. It&#x2019;s rusted to hell. You could sneeze a hole in it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Old Mel. Wear and tear on the tools. All that added time...&#x201d;<br>This was a lesson learned for Mel. A brain dent did not necessarily affect a young man&#x2019;s ability to extort.<br>&#x201c;All right, look. I&#x2019;m not going to pay you to start a new well somewhere else, so why don&#x2019;t we just say&nbsp;... what? Fifty&nbsp;<i>baht</i>&nbsp;extra? How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br>There was no further discussion. The nephew began jabbing the crowbar into the metal plate with renewed enthusiasm. With the fifty&nbsp;<i>baht</i>&nbsp;incentive, the young man performed like a large, enthusiastic can opener. He stood at the center of the hole and gouged through the metal around him. Like Mel, he&#x2019;d probably expected to be able to lift out a perfect circle of rusted metal and continue his dig south uninterrupted. He would have anticipated a firm grounding of earth beneath the metal. He probably didn&#x2019;t expect in his wildest and most troubling dreams to hear that teeth-grinding creak, or to have the metal upon which he stood drop like a theatrical trapdoor. He seemed to hover in midair for a split second before plummeting into the dark void beneath him.<br>The silence that followed stretched into the hot early morning like warm noodle dough. Crickets and songbirds held their breaths. A solitary wispy cloud hung overhead. Mel stood leaning forward slightly to look into the hole but all he could see was blackness. He didn&#x2019;t recall the lad&#x2019;s name so he couldn&#x2019;t call it out.<br>&#x201c;You all right there?&#x201d; he said. Then, realizing the newly opened shaft might be vastly deep he shouted the same question. &#x201c;YOU ALL RIGHT?&#x201d;<br>There was no reply.<br>A number of lands around the globe have what they refer to as a southern temperament. Thailand is no exception. Old Mel could surely have gone running off screaming for help. He might have beaten a pestle against the old tin tub that hung from his balcony or trekked those two kilometers to the nearest payphone. But he was a southerner. He broke off a stem of sweet grass to chew while he sat on the concrete segment and gazed into the abyss. There was a good deal to consider. Perhaps this had been a blessing in disguise. He wondered whether they&#x2019;d chanced on an old well shaft. Saved themselves time. But there&#x2019;d been no splash. It was probably dry. Bad luck, that.<br>&#x201c;Young fellow?&#x201d; he called again, half-heartedly.<br>There was still no response.<br>Mel wondered just how long was a suitable period of time before he should get anxious. He was in the middle of a plan. Go back to the shed. Get a rope. Tie it to the fence. Lower it into the hole, and&nbsp;... but there was his back problem. That wouldn&#x2019;t work. He&#x2019;d have to call his neighbor, Gai, to&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Old Mel.&#x201d;<br>The voice was odd, echoey, like that of a lone sardine in a tin can.<br>&#x201c;Old Mel. You there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you playing at down there?&#x201d; Mel asked. &#x201c;You stuck?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no. I had the wind knocked out of me, that&#x2019;s all, but I chanced lucky. I&#x2019;m on&nbsp;... a bed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they call concussion, boy. You need a&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m on a bed. Really I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What makes you think so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can feel the springs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Plant roots, boy. Easily mistaken for bedsprings.&#x201d;<br>Mel realized that in the nephew&#x2019;s case, concussion wouldn&#x2019;t have made a lot of difference.<br>&#x201c;All right, look, I need to fetch somebody,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;You know, I can probably get myself out, Old Mel. I&#x2019;m not so far from the hole. I&#x2019;m looking up at it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You injured?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but my shirt&#x2019;s snagged on one of the springs. You should come down and have a look. This is odd, Old Mel. The more my eyes get used to the dark, the odder it is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What can you see, boy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Windows.&#x201d;<br>Old Mel chuckled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on a bed and you&#x2019;ve got windows round you? Sounds to me like you&#x2019;ve found yourself an underground bedroom. What are the odds of that?&#x201d;<br>He was wondering where the nearest psychiatric care unit might be. Whether analysis was included under the government thirty-<i>baht</i>&nbsp;universal health initiative.<br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s...&#x201d; the nephew began.<br>&#x201c;A bedside lamp?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, no. Old Mel. Old Mel.&#x201d;<br>There was a real panicky timbre to his voice.<br>&#x201c;What? What is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s skeletons down here.&#x201d;<br>Mel was hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t have to be responsible in some way for the young fellow&#x2019;s rehabilitation. Whether he&#x2019;d be obliged to employ him in some menial position in which his affliction wouldn&#x2019;t be too much of a disadvantage. Scarecrow, perhaps? Maybe he could find a witness who&#x2019;d swear the boy was already eight points brain-dead before he fell down the old well shaft.

Includes contributions by two recently departed leading lights: playwright Wendy Wasserstein and songwriter Cy Coleman. Also, featured are Chita Rivera and Edward Albee; costume designer William Ivey Long; set designer Robin Wagner, and director and choreographer Susan Stroman.</p><p>ROBERT VIAGAS is a New York theatre journalist and author. He is the editor of the new 21st-century edition of <i>At This Theatre</i> (1-55783-566-7'), 'founding editor of the new annual Playbill <i>Broadway Yearbook</i> (1-55783-682-5); and co-author of <i>The Amazing Story of The Fantasticks</i>. He currently serves as Program Director of Playbill Broadcast, and Editor of Playbill Books. He lives in Mamaroneck, New York.Like a typical Broadway season, this collection of essays on the various crafts of the theater trade is intermittently brilliant, self-serving and tedious. The central conceit of having directors, performers and various backstage wizards discuss the fine art of professional collaboration is a clever one that would seem to promise a generous helping of diva sagas and in-house backbiting. Instead, too many contributors take the concept as an excuse to name-check a relatively small group of favorite artists to work with, giving the proceedings the air of an extremely long Tony Awards ceremony. Thankfully, this collection is stocked with contributions from so many luminaries that there is still a bounty of excellent material, such as Edward Albee's cranky-sounding statement, "No one collaborates with me on a play." Cy Colman, the legendary late composer, provides one of the longest and most entertaining segments, waxing candidly about his sometimes volatile songwriting partnerships and the often difficult realities of bringing a show to the stage. Despite the book's choppiness, old-timers like Colman lend a poignant consistency with their elegies for a more dynamic, less focus-tested Broadway that they agree, sadly, has probably passed for good. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The 4,000-year history of cryptography has been a kind of arms race: Each time a more complex encryption has been developed, it has been attacked and, more often than not, decoded; and each time, in response, codemakers have produced tougher and tougher codes. <i>Codebreaker</i> surveys the entire history of codes through an eloquent narrative and an evocative range of illustrations, paying special attention to famous codes that have never been broken, such as the Beale Ciphers, the Voynich manuscript, the Easter Island code, and many more. Many great names in history appear throughout, from Caesar and Mary Queen of Scots, to Samuel Morse and Alan Turing. The narrative is based in part on interviews with cryptology experts, Navaho windtalkers, decryption experts, and law enforcement experts, and ends with a vision of the coded future via quantum cryptography.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Pincock is a news editor for <i>The Scientist</i> magazine, and a science columnist for the <i>Financial Times</i> magazine.

A Vermont couple--Bill and Harper Parrish--lose their son Nathaniel to leukemia when he's only ten, and the process of grieving includes both ferocious lovemaking and a decision by Bill (a development officer at a local college) to coach the town's Triple A level Little League team, ``the level that Nathaniel would have reached'' in a year. Among the ten- and eleven-year-olds appears Lucky Diamond, a mute who writes on a notepad. The story of Lucky--apparently the son of a mountain logger--begins to overlap with flashbacks of Nathaniel (playing dice baseball with Bill in the hospital); job and coaching incidents; and the domestic healing taking place between Bill and Harper (she finally gets pregnant). We enter ``a 5 a.m. world of fathers without sons.'' Meanwhile, Lucky, who lives in a remote mobile home, doesn't seem to attend school. Bill, protective of Lucky, finally gives him Nathaniel's old glove when his glove is stolen; then, after a series of offstage accidents, Bill confronts the commissioner of the Little League, who knows something. What's discovered is that Lucky's real father was the pro ballplayer Ben Slaughter, who died in a car wreck and left behind a pregnant young lover. While all of these later revelations are a bit forced, Bohjalian cleverly works out the ending every reader will see coming from a mile away. Bill adopts Lucky. Harper has her baby, and the world is an almost perfect place. Bohjalian handles Little League and his Vermont milieu well enough, but this one's too predictable in its overall pattern if not in its particulars. Still, a good get-out-your-handkerchief read for ball fans. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this accomplished third novel by the author of Hangman , narrator Bill Parrish and his wife, Harper, have lost their only child, Nathaniel, age 10, to acute lymphocytic leukemia. Searching for a way to deal with his grief, Bill agrees to coach the Little League team that Nathaniel would have played for had he lived to see another summer. Among his young charges is Lucky Diamond, a mute child with a mysterious background. Like Nathaniel, Lucky is a gifted natural athlete with a sweet smile. Gradually, Bill finds himself drawn into Lucky's mystery--a father no one has ever seen, school records that can't be found, a series of sinister accidents that point to Lucky as the possessor of strange powers. Indeed, as the book progresses one fears that Bohjalian will cheapen its very real insights into grief with a faux -Stephen King supernatural plot, but he is a better writer than that. The book's final revelations, while a trifle mechanical, take it in vastly more profound direction altogether. Bohjalian has a fine feeling for emotions, and draws his characters with real affection. Eschewing predictable melodramatic violence, he has created a moving portrait of some decent people trying to cope with the powerful forces of grief and loss, which he leavens withdb (too many some's) very funny recollections of life in Little League. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Harry Builds a House</h2><p>Harry Hippo and his crew of hard-hatted construction workers build a new house, from the basement to the rooftop, as young children discover all the steps involved in the construction of their own homes</p><p></p><h2>The Psychology of Self-Esteem</h2><p>Dr. Branden has created a series of lectures which substantially updates and expands upon the materials in &#34;The Psycology of Self-Esteem, Breaking Free,&#34; and &#34;The Disowned Self.&#34; Here are some of the highlights of this comprehensive presentation of Biocentric Psycology: The need, the motivating power of self-esteem, its relationship to love, work, and personal relationships, man-woman relationships, emotions, disowning the self, alienation, anxiety, depression, and more. 30 audio CDs (26 hrs.)

To supplement the pictures, the editor Carolyn Heilbrun has selected key extracts from many diaries, letters, poems, and other writings in which Lady Ottoline&#39;s guests talked about themselves and each other -- pointedly, wittily, and frankly, as might be expected from so literate a group. Lord David Cecil, the historian (and a visitor at Garsington himself in the great days), contributes a fond introduction. Lady Ottoline&#39;s Album is a delight for anyone touched by an interest in Bloomsbury or the wider scene of British cultural life between the wars, a treasure of literary nostalgia, an era caught in movement and preserved.</p><p></p><h2>To Have and To Kill: Nurse Melanie McGuire, an Illicit Affair, and the Gruesome Murder of Her Husband</h2><p><p>One by one, three waterlogged suitcases were pulled from the Chesapeake Bay.

A comprehensive look at the history and character of Italian garden architecture and ornamentation, the book explores more than seventy-five villas, capturing what Wharton calls their "garden-magic" and illuminating the intimate relationship between the house, its formal gardens, and the surrounding countryside.This beautiful hardcover facsimile is carefully reproduced from the first edition published in 1904 and features all of the original plates, including twenty-six illustrations by Maxfield Parrish, as well as d�collage edges. It is published in association with The Mount Press. A portion of the proceeds of the sale of the book support the restoration of The Mount, the Massachusetts estate designed and built by Wharton based on the principles articulated in this book and in The Decoration of Houses. Elegantly written and informed by Wharton&#x2019;s sensitivity and wit, Italian Villas and Their Gardens is a work that belongs on the shelf of every lover of gardens and good taste.</p><p>Edith Wharton (1862&#x2013;1937) was the first woman awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Yale University, and full membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

His paintings for his books are on permanent rotating exhibition at the South Dakota Art Museum. He lives with his wife in Rapid City, South Dakota.Native American legend and Goble's (The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses) award-winning artwork coalesce to bring another mythic tale grandly to life. Recounting the origin of both Blackfoot tipis and their symbolic designs, Caldecott-winner Goble employs several distinct media: black-and-white diagrams, photographs and his trademark watercolor and gouache paintings. Napi, the Great Spirit's helper, was inspired by the shape of a leaf to provide the first man and women with a tipi for shelter. Eloquently melding geometric and naturalistic free-form designs, Goble places this initial story inside a large painting of a cottonwood leaf and demonstrates its inspiration by superimposing a tipi diagram over the leaf shape at the bottom of the page. A spread then gives intricate step-by-step instructions of how to pitch a tipi. Through the sweeping panoramas of his watercolors, Goble next relates the story of how spirit paintings came to exist on Blackfoot tipis. When Sacred Otter and his son become trapped in a blizzard, the man dreams that he visits Storm Maker's tipi. Full-spread vertical views of the tipi's exterior and interior reveal Goble at his finest, intermingling texture, form and color. "When the warm weather returns, paint one just like it. Then your family will be safe from storms always," Storm Maker commands. Goble's instructive storytelling prepares readers for this stunning visual adventure.

Reprint. <i>PW. </i></p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.Lush, sprawling escapist fiction of the first order, the third installment of the Cazalet Chronicle opens in the spring of 1942 and continues the saga begun in The Light Years and Marking Time. Set in London and the English countryside, much of the story focuses on the eldest Cazalet cousins, Louise, Polly and Clary, as they exit their teens and take their first steps into adulthood. Former acting student Louise has been swept into a brilliant but chilly marriage to Michael Hadleigh, a glamorous portrait painter and aspiring Member of Parliament whose life is controlled by his powerful mother. Best friends Polly and Clary leave the cozy confines of the Cazalet's country home to begin what they hope will be terribly grown-up lives in London. While Polly mourns the recent death of her mother, Clary keeps a journal that she hopes to give to her father, who has been missing since the invasion of Normandy. Alternating with the cousins' stories are chapters devoted to the rest of the Cazalet clan, their friends and lovers, bringing readers up to date on the doings of adulterous Edward, his dutiful spinster sister Rachel, her loving best friend Margot Sidney and others. Howard creates a nearly palpaple world, peopled with the sort of well-conceived characters that linger long in the reader's mind. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Treasures of State: Fine and Decorative Arts in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the U.S. Department of State</h2><p>Fine and decorative arts in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the U.

The world would split open." Houdini's response, "It has. Now I am going after it&#x2014;all pieces." With subtexts of desire, race, grief, and love, Houdini presents Rukeyser's gorgeous, reaching language and her brilliant observations of the human psyche. The musical will appeal to young bell-bottomed readers as well as Houdini devotees, poetry fans, drama people, and escape artists everywhere.<br><br>A recipient of an NEA, <i>Houdini</i> joins the Rukeyser resurgence that is well underway&#x2014;with the Paris Press publications of <i>The Life of Poetry</i> and <i>The Orgy,</i> and the University of Pittsburgh's 2002 reissue of <i>The Collected Poems.</i></p><p><br>Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) is one of our country's most influential yet neglected writers. She published fifteen collections of poetry, plays, translations, children's books, and several works of nonfiction. Her "toys of fame" include the Yale Younger Poets Award, the Copernicus Award from the Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Shelley Memorial Award. From 1975-1976, she served as president of P.E.N. American Center.Rukeyser (1913-80) wrote clarion poems that illuminate the interface of the personal and the political, children's books, plays, biographies, and one strange and beautiful verse drama, this metaphorically lush and wryly incisive interpretation of the psyche and art of Harry Houdini. Her musical was performed once in 1973 with Christopher Walken playing the title role, and then was set aside, unpublished until now. A powerfully provocative figure, Houdini inspires Rukesyer to ponder our love/hate relationship with the body, our desire for magic and acceptance of illusion, the link between exhibitionism and exorcism, and the eroticism of bondage and the myth of escapism. Rukeyser's Houdini is simultaneously a jaded performer who bamboozles his audience and a mystic, a man who vehemently attacked phony spiritualists yet who pined for communion with his dead. And then there's his wife, Bess, emblematic, for Rukesyer, of longing and stoicism, who utters one of the poet's most resounding lines, "What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? The world would split open." <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like decking out our poor lost troopers for marriage rather than death. All their uniforms brushed down with lamp-oil into a state never seen when they were alive. Their faces clean shaved, as if the embalmer sure didn&#x2019;t like no whiskers showing. No one that knew him could have recognised Trooper Watchorn because those famous Dundrearies was gone. Anyway Death likes to make a stranger of your face. True enough their boxes weren&#x2019;t but cheap wood but that was not the point. You lift one of those boxes and the body makes a big sag in it. Wood cut so thin at the mill it was more a wafer than a plank. But dead boys don&#x2019;t mind things like that. The point was, we were glad to see them so well turned out, considering.<br><br> I am talking now about the finale of my first engagement in the business of war. 1851 it was most likely. Since the bloom was gone off me, I had volunteered&nbsp; aged seventeen in Missouri. If you had all your limbs they took you. If you were a one-eyed boy they might take you too even so. The only pay worse than the worst pay in America was army pay. And they fed you queer stuff till&nbsp;your shit just stank. But you were glad to get work because if you didn&#x2019;t work for the few dollars in America you hungered, I had learned that lesson. Well, I was sick of hungering.<br><br>Believe me when I say there is a certain type of man loves soldiering, no matter how mean the pay. First thing, you got a horse. He might be a spavined nag, he might be plagued by colic, he might show a goitre in his neck the size of a globe, but he was a horse. Second place, you got a uniform. It might have certain shortcomings in the stitching department, but it was a uniform. Blue as a bluebottle&#x2019;s hide.<br><br> Swear to God, army was a good life. I was seventeen or there- abouts beginning, I could not say for certain. I will not say the years going up to my army days was easy. But all that dancing put muscle on me, in a wiry sort of way. I&#x2019;m not speaking against my customers, I&#x2019;m speaking for them. If you pay a dollar for a dance you like a good few sweeps of the floor for that, God knows.<br><br> Yes, the army took me, I&#x2019;m proud to say. Thank God John Cole was my first friend in America and so in the army too and the last friend for that matter. He was with me nearly all through this exceeding surprising Yankee sort of life which was good going in every way. No more than a boy like me but even at six- teen years old he looked like a man right enough. I first saw him when he was fourteen or so, very different. That&#x2019;s what the saloon owner said too. Time&#x2019;s up, fellas, you ain&#x2019;t kids no more, he says. Dark face, black eyes, Indian eyes they called them that time. Glittering. Older fellas in the platoon said Indians were just evil boys, blank-faced evil boys fit to kill you soon as look at you. Said Indians were to be cleared off the face of the earth, most like that would be the best policy. Soldiers like to talk high. That&#x2019;s how courage is made most like, said John Cole, being an understanding man.<br><br> John Cole and me we came to the volunteering point together of course. We was offering ourselves in a joint sale I guess and the same look of the arse out of his trousers that I had he had too. Like twins. Well when we finished up at the saloon we didn&#x2019;t leave in no dresses. We must have looked like beggar boys. He was born in New England where the strength died out of his father&#x2019;s earth. John Cole was only twelve when he lit out a-wandering. First moment I saw him I thought, there&#x2019;s a pal. That&#x2019;s what it was. Thought he was a dandy-looking sort of boy. Pinched though he was in the face by hunger. Met him under a hedge in goddamn Missouri. We was only under the hedge as a consequence the heavens were open in a downpour. Way out on those mudflats beyond old St Louis. Expect to see a sheltering duck sooner than a human. Heavens open. I scarper for cover and suddenly he&#x2019;s there. Might have never seen him otherwise. Friend for a whole life. Strange and fateful encounter you could say. Lucky. But first thing he draws a little sharp knife he carried made of a broken spike. He was intending to stick it in me if I looked to go vicious against him. He was a very kept-back-looking thirteen years old I reckon. Anyhows under the hedge aforementioned when we got to talking he said his great-grandma was a Indian whose people were run out of the east long since. Over in Indian country now. He had never met them. Don&#x2019;t know why he told me that so soon only I was very friendly and<br> maybe he thought he would lose that blast of friendship if I didn&#x2019;t know the bad things quickly. Well. I told him how best to look at that. Me, the child of poor Sligonians blighted likewise. No, us McNultys didn&#x2019;t got much to crow about.<br><br> Maybe out of respect for the vulnerable soul of John Cole I might skip ahead violently and avoid an account of our earlier years. Except he might also acknowledge that those years were important in their way and I cannot say either that they constituted in any way a time of shameful suffering in particular. Were they shameful? I don&#x2019;t see eye to eye with that. Let me call them our dancing days. Why the hell not. After all we was only children obliged to survive in a dangerous terrain. And survive we did and as you see I have lived to tell the tale. Having made our acquaintance under an anonymous hedge it seemed natural and easy to join together in the enterprise of continuing survival. That is John Cole in his minority and I placed our steps side by side on the rainy road and proceeded into the next town in that frontier district where there were hundreds of rough miners working and a half dozen tumultuous saloons set up in a muddy thoroughfare endeavouring to entertain them.<br><br> Not that we knew much of that. In these times John Cole was a slight boy as I have laboured to illustrate with his river-black eyes and his lean face as sharp as a hunting dog. I was my younger self. That is though I was maybe fifteen after my Irish and Canadian and American adventures I looked as young as him. But I had no idea what I looked like. Children may feel epic and large to theyselves and yet be only scraps to view.<br><br> Just sick of stumbling round. Two is better together, he said.<br><br> So then our idea was to find work slopping out or any of the jobs abhorrent to decent folk. We didn&#x2019;t know much about adult persons. We just didn&#x2019;t know hardly a thing. We were willing to do anything and even exulted in the fact. We were ready to go down into sewers and shovel the shit along. We might have been happy to commit obscure murders, if it didn&#x2019;t involve capture and punishment, we didn&#x2019;t know. We were two wood-shavings of humanity in a rough world. We were of the opinion our share of food was there if we sought it out. The bread of heaven John Cole called it because after the fall of his father he has much frequented those places where hymns and meagre food was put into him in equal measure.<br><br> Weren&#x2019;t many places like that in Daggsville. Weren&#x2019;t any. Daggsville was all uproar, mucky horses, banging doors, queer shouting. By this time in my biographical ventures I must con- fess I was wearing an old wheat-sack, tied at the waist. It sorta looked like clothing but not much. John Cole was better in an old queer black suit that musta been three hundred years old, judging by the gaps in it. Anyway he was having a breezy time of it about the crotch, far as I could see. You could nearly reach in and measure his manhood, so your eyes did their best to be kept looking away. I devised a good method to deal with such a thing and fixed fiercely on his face, which was no work in itself, it was a pleasing face. Next thing comes up in our view a spanking new building all fresh wood and even a last sparkle in the recently beaten nailheads. Saloon a sign said, no more nor less. And underneath, on a smaller sign hanging from a string,&nbsp;Clean boys wanted.<br><br> Look, see, says John Cole, who didn&#x2019;t have the great learning I had, but had a little none the less. Well, he says, by my mother&#x2019;s loving heart, we do fulfil half of that requirement.<br> Straight in, and there was a highly pleasant quotient of good dark wood, dark panelling floor to ceiling, a long bar as sleek and black as an oil-seep. Then we felt like bugs in a girl&#x2019;s bonnet. Alien. Pictures of those fine American scenes of grandeur that are more comfortable to gaze on than to be in. Man there behind the bar, complete with chamois cloth, philosophically polishing a surface that needed no polishing. It was plain to see all was a new enterprise. There was a carpenter finishing up on the stairs going to the upward rooms, fitting the last section of a rail. The bartender had his eyes closed or he might have seen us sooner. Might even have given us the bum&#x2019;s rush. Then the eyes open and instead of the drawing back and cussing at us we ex- pected this more discerning individual smiled, looked pleased to see us.<br><br> You looking for clean boys? says John Cole, a tincture pugilistic right enough, still prophesying menaces.<br><br> You are right welcome, the man says. We are? said John Cole.<br><br> You are. You are just the thing, especially the smaller one there, he says. <br><br>That was me he was meaning. Then, as if he feared John Cole might take offence and stamp out away &#x2013; But you&#x2019;ll do too, he says. I&#x2019;m giving fifty cents a night, fifty cents a night each, and all you can drink, if you drink easy, and you can bunk down in the stable behind us, yes indeed, cosy and comfortable and warm as cats. That&#x2019;s if you give satisfaction.<br><br> And what&#x2019;s the work? says John, suspicious. <br><br>Easiest work in the world, he says.<br><br>Such as?<br><br> Why, dancing, dancing is all it is. Just dancing.<br><br> We ain&#x2019;t no dancers far as I know, says John, flummoxed now, violently disappointed.<br><br> You don&#x2019;t need to be dancers as such in the accepted dictionary definition of the word, says the man. It&#x2019;s not high-kicking anyhow.<br><br> Alright, says John, lost now just from a sense aspect &#x2013; but, we ain&#x2019;t got no clothes to be dancing in, that&#x2019;s for sure, he said, displaying his very particular condition.<br><br> Why, all&#x2019;s supplied, all&#x2019;s supplied, he says.<br><br> The carpenter had paused in his work and was sitting on the steps now, smiling big.<br><br> Come with me, gentlemen, says the bartender, likely the owner too, with his swank, and I will show you your clothing of work.<br><br> Then he strode over his spanking new floor in his noisy boots, and opened the door into his office. It had a sign on it said Office so we knew. Why, boys, after you, he said, holding the door. I got my manners. And I hope you got your manners, because even rough miners love manners, yes indeed.<br><br> So we troop in, all eyes. There&#x2019;s a rack of clothes like a gaggle of hanged women. Because it&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s clothes. Dresses. There was nothing else there, and we looked around thoroughly, we did.<br><br> Dancing starts eight sharp, he says. Pick something that fits.&nbsp;Fifty cents, each. And any tips you get is yours to keep.<br><br> But, mister, says John Cole, like he was talking to a pitiful insane person. We ain&#x2019;t no women. Can&#x2019;t you see. I is a boy and so is Thomas here.<br><br> No, you ain&#x2019;t women, I can see. I could verify that second you came in. You fine young boys. Sign says looking for boys. I would gladly sign up women but ain&#x2019;t no women in Daggs- ville but the storeman&#x2019;s wife and the stableman&#x2019;s little daughter. Otherwise it&#x2019;s all men here. But men without women can get to pining. It&#x2019;s a sort of sadness gets into their hearts. I aim to get it out and make a few bucks in the process, yes, sir, the great American way. They need only the illusion, only the illusion of the gentler sex. You&#x2019;re it, if you take this employment. It&#x2019;s just the dancing. No kissing, cuddling, feeling, or fumbling. Why, just the nicest, the most genteel dancing. You won&#x2019;t hardly credit how nice, how gentle a rough miner dances. Make you cry to see it. You sure is pretty enough in your way, if you don&#x2019;t mind me saying, especially the smaller one. But you&#x2019;ll do too, you&#x2019;ll do too, he says, seeing John Cole&#x2019;s newly acquired pro- fessional pride coming up again. Then he cocks an eyebrow, interrogatory like.<br><br> John Cole looks at me. I didn&#x2019;t care. Better than starving in a wheat-sack.<br><br> Alright, he says.<br><br> Gonna put a bath for you in the stable. Gonna give you soap. Gonna supply the underwears, muy importante. Brought with me from St Louis. You&#x2019;ll fill them fine, boys, I reckon&nbsp; you&#x2019;ll fill them fine, and after a few glasses no man I know will object. A new era in the history of Daggsville. When the lonesome men got girls to dance with. And all in a comely fashion, in a comely fashion.<br> And so we trooped out again, shrugging our shoulders, as if to say, it was a mad world, but a lucky one too, now and then. Fifty cents, each. How many times, in how many bowers before sleep in our army days, out on the prairie, in lonesome decliv- ities, we liked to repeat that, John and me, over and over, and never failing in our laughter, Fifty cents &#x2013; each.<br><br> That particular night in the lost history of the world Mr Titus Noone, for that was his name, helped us into our dresses with a sort of manly discretion. Give him his due, he seemed to know about buttons and ribbons and such. He had even had the fore- sight to sprinkle us with perfumes. This was the cleanest I had been in three years, maybe ever. I had not been noted in Ireland for my cleanliness truth be told, poor farmers don&#x2019;t see baths. When there is no food to eat the first thing that goes is even a flimsy grasp of hygiene.<br><br> The saloon filled quickly. Posters had been speedily put up around town, and the miners had answered the call. Me and John Cole sat on two chairs against a wall. Very girl-like, well behaved, sedate, and nice. We never even looked at the miners, we stared straight ahead. We hadn&#x2019;t ever seen too many sedate girls but a inspiration got into us. I had a yellow wig of hair and John had a red one. We musta looked like the flag of some country from the neck up, sitting there. Mr Noone had thoughtfully filled out our bodices with cotton. Okay but our feet were bare, he said he had forgotten shoes in St Louis. They might be a later addition. He said to mind where the miners stepped, we said we would. Funny how as soon as we hove into those dresses everything changed. I never felt so contented in my life. All miseries and worries fled away. I was a new man now, a new girl. I was freed, like those slaves were freed in the coming war. I was ready for anything. I felt dainty, strong, and perfected. That&#x2019;s the truth. I don&#x2019;t know how it took John Cole, he never said. You had to love John Cole for what he chose never to say. He said plenty of the useful stuff. But he never speaked against that line of work, even when it went bad for us, no. We were the first girls in Daggsville and we weren&#x2019;t the worst.<br><br> Every citizen knows that miners are all sorts of souls. They come into a country, I seen it a thousand times, and strip away all the beauty, and then there is black filth in the rivers and the trees just seem to wither back like affronted maids. They like rough food, rough whisky, rough nights, and truth to tell, if you is a Indian gi...</p><h2>Rock Paintings of the Chumash: a Study of a California Indian Culture</h2><p>This is a serious, comprehensive and yet concise book on the rock paintings at Santa Barbara by the Chumash. He gave a good background information on the people, settlement, society, technology, language, religion and shamanism, food gathering and preparation and inter-tribal relationships so that reader has an understanding on this tribe. He then elaborated on the painting on the location, subject mater, size, pigments, techniques and styles with pictures. It is a labor intensive job in visiting, documenting, photographing and researching. He raised the questions of what do they mean, how old are they. He showed the cataloging of the sites with detail. It is an arm chair pleasure journey to study with him. Over time, erosion and vandalism are the destroying factors. These rock paintings are by no means the ancient graffiti. They are the Chumash ancient motifs of man and nature. This is an enjoyable book and we need to treasure and protect this important California history of Native Americans.</p><p></p><h2>The Gentle Art of Domesticity: Stitching, Baking, Nature, Art &amp; the Comforts of Home</h2><p>Jane Brocket delights in domesticity.

Taskin, Commander of the Royal Guard, whose icy competence and impressive life-term as the Crown&#39;s right-hand man command the kingdom&#39;s deep-seated respect; and Mykkael, the rough-hewn newcomer who has won the post of Captain of the Garrison-a scarred veteran with a deadly record of field warfare, whose &#39;interesting&#39; background and foreign breeding are held in contempt by court society. As the princess&#39;s trail vanishes outside the citadel&#39;s gates, anxiety and tension escalate.

But never has a story moved so explosively forward, or written itself with such a fury as To Ride Hell's Chasm. <p>In hindsight, I wanted to create an intrigue story that flowered into intense action, with the highest of human stakes set upon the value of true?sighted integrity.

"Patriotism is more than a map or a statue. But how do I show that?" His poster-board display featuring a photo of his absent father, a soldier in desert fatigues, illustrates the child's deep, personal connection to the abstract concept. The setup feels artificial, but Skeers paces things well to maximize the dramatic impact of Dad's military role, which is revealed relatively late in the story. Expressive watercolors from Hoyt (illustrator of John Lithgow's <i>I'm a Manatee, </i>2003) sensitively capture the commingled pain and pride of military separation but also make room for welcome silliness, expressed through anthropomorphized national symbols that run riot inside Caleb's head.

Many examples have survived from antiquity, dating mostly from c. 1500 BCE-250 BCE. In this volume, the text translated by the late Dr. R.O.

Stubbs provides a rich and substantive Christian reading of Numbers, focusing on its vision of who the people of God are to be, the failure of the people to live up to God's vision and God's faithfulness in spite of that failure, and the reorganization and new beginning of an emerging generation of God's people as they prepare for life in the promised land of Canaan. Stubbs interacts responsibly with current Old Testament scholarship on Numbers. He also expands his commentary into a dense theological dialogue with New Testament texts, modern Jewish interpreters, and a wide array of Christian interpreters. And he takes up a host of substantive theological issues and concerns. Stubbs manages to offer up a sumptuous theological feast out of what is sometimes seen as the dry fare of the book of Numbers."--<b>Dennis Olson</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Stubbs's sophisticated literary approach is just what is needed to engage the interplay of law and narrative in this, the most complex book of the Torah. Moreover, his wide-ranging theological and ecclesial imagination is deeply informed by scripture and the history of its interpretation by both Jews and Christians. Stubbs has opened up the riches of a book that was effectively closed to the church, making it accessible and even indispensable for our journey with God."--<b>Ellen F.

With the church of our day so divided and confused, we have never more needed to hear God's word from the book of Numbers, this most ecclesiological of books. God willing, with the patient guidance of Stubbs and other theologians like him, we may yet find our way through the desert of our failings and besetting sins."--<b>Nathan MacDonald</b>, Cambridge University and St. John's College, Cambridge<br><br>"The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible is a crucial venture, and Stubbs's <i>Numbers</i> is a most welcome addition. With great passion for the text and the people it seeks to form, Stubbs demonstrates that the theological wisdom of the past helps to display the profound importance of the book of Numbers for the cultivation of scripturally shaped ecclesial life. No less does Stubbs's commentary show the interpretive merits gained by thorough interaction with modern biblical study. In short, Stubbs is to be commended for his steadfast rejection of the false alternative so often posed between ancient and contemporary hermeneutical strategies. Stubbs reads this Old Testament book with an interpretive patience, literary attentiveness, and theological freedom that invite us all to return to the text and consider it more closely--surely a proper end of any theological exegesis worth its name."--<b>C. Kavin Rowe</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"The editors of the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible have chosen theologians for whom doctrine is a living engagement with the tradition, a habit of mind and heart, not a chiseling of propositions on stone tablets--theologians like David Stubbs. His commentary on Numbers helps to bridge the divide that has arisen between theologians and exegetes to the impoverishment of both and the Church. He sees in the diverse material of Numbers a consistent portrayal of God as a 'burning fire that tests us and ultimately cleanses us to make us holy.'"--<b>Thomas A.

He studied mathematics, philosophy, and history at Munich and Berlin. Except for his doctor's thesis on Heraclitus, he published nothing before the first volume of The Decline of the West, which appeared when he was thirty-eight. The Agadir crisis of 1911 provided the immediate incentive for his exhaustive investigations of the background and origins of our civilization. He chose his main title in 1912, finished the first draft of "Form and Actuality" ("Gestalt und Wirklichkeit") two years later, and published the volume in 1918. The second, extensively revised edition, from which the present translation was made, appeared in 1923. The concluding volume, "Perspectives of World-History" ("Welthistorische Perspektiven"), was published in 1922. The Decline of the West was first published in this country in 1906 (Vol. I) and 1928 (Vol. II).<br><br>For many years Spengler lived quietly in his home in Munich. thinking, writing, and pursuing his hobbies - the collecting of pictures and primitive weapons, listening to Beethoven quartets, reading the comedies of Shakespeare and Moliere, and taking occasional trips to the Harz Mountains and to Italy.

Mac McKenzie Novels)</h2><p><p>Since becoming an unlikely millionaire and quitting the St. Paul Police Department, Rushmore McKenzie has been working as an unlicensed private investigator, basically doing favors for friends and people in need. But even for him, this latest job is unusual. He's been asked to find a stolen Stradivarius, known as the Countess Borromeo, that only the violinist seems to want him to find. </p><p>Stolen from a locked room in a B&amp;B in the violinist's former hometown of Bayfield, Wisconsin, the violin is valued at $4 million and is virtually irreplaceable. But the foundation that owns it and their insurance company refuses to think about buying it back from the thief (or thieves.) However, Paul Duclos, the violinist who has played it for the past twelve years, is desperate to get it back and will pay out of his own pocket to get it back. </p><p>Though it's not his usual sort of case, McKenzie is intrigued and decides to try and help, which means going against the local police, the insurance company, the FBI's Art Crime division, and his own lawyer's advice. And, as he quickly learns, there's a lot more going on than the mere theft of a priceless instrument.</p></p><p>DAVID HOUSEWRIGHT has won the Edgar Award and is the three-time winner of the Minnesota Book Award for his crime fiction.

When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out."</i><p> Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up. </p><p> Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from <i>Dracula</i> and plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind "when you really see them." By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Insight Study Guides are written by experts and cover a range of popular literature, plays and films.

Both sides of the street swarmed with agitated people, as if someone had stirred up an ants&#x2019; nest in Lower Manhattan. Everywhere he looked, people were shouting&#x2014;some actually shrieking in their excitement&#x2014;adding to a cacophony of outraged honking as yellow cabs, delivery trucks, and passenger cars tried to navigate around pedestrians who darted back and forth across the street.<br> <br>The angriest and loudest voice blared from the small grassy park opposite the massive gray edifice. A short, cadaverous-looking black man on a bullhorn urged the crowd. &#x201c;What do we want?&#x201d; He cupped his ear to hear the response.<br> <br>&#x201c;JUSTICE!&#x201d; the crowd screamed.<br> <br>&#x201c;When do we want it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;NOW!&#x201d;<br> <br>On the sidewalk in front of the building, a cordon of black-uniformed riot police in helmets and carrying clear polycarbonate shields stood shoulder to shoulder in a large semicircle. Their job was to keep the mass of amped-up demonstrators and curious onlookers a safe distance away from a bevy of microphones that news crews had arranged at the top of a small flight of stairs leading to the entrance. More officers, in both uniforms and plainclothes, patrolled the sidewalk outside the human barrier, on alert for danger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesucristo!&#x201d; swore Vansand&#x2019;s driver, Julio Escobar, who doubled as his cameraman. &#x201c;Going to be hell to park, and I got to carry that heavy-ass camera. Looks like the freakin&#x2019; circus is in town, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More like somebody left the doors open on the Bellevue psych ward and the inmates got out,&#x201d; Vansand muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good for ratings.&#x201d; Escobar shrugged with a sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for us if we don&#x2019;t get set up in time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the idiot who sent us on that fluff story to Coney Island.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stupid news director,&#x201d; Vansand agreed. He was growing more agitated as traffic slowed to a crawl.<br> <br>&#x201c;WHAT DO WE WANT?&#x201d; the speaker bellowed.<br> <br>&#x201c;JUSTICE!&#x201d; the crowd screeched.<br> <br>Even with the windows of the van rolled up to keep out the oppressive summer heat, Vansand recognized the strident baritone of the man on the megaphone as that of Reverend Hussein &#x201c;Skip&#x201d; Mufti, an &#x201c;activist&#x201d; Baptist minister from Harlem known more for his inflammatory politics than his work in any church. The journalist scowled. He thought he had an &#x201c;understanding&#x201d; with the reverend for exclusivity on interviews, but Mufti had been enjoying the current crisis by eagerly accepting every invitation from the national news shows that had flocked to Gotham. He&#x2019;ll come crawling when the big dogs are gone and I&#x2019;ve got the best soapbox in town, Vansand thought. Ol&#x2019; Hussein likes his expensive dinners and bottles of wine on the station&#x2019;s credit card, but he&#x2019;s going to have to do some serious ass kissing to get back on my good side.<br> <br>Vansand checked his Rolex. It was five minutes until two o&#x2019;clock, when New York County District Attorney Roger &#x201c;Butch&#x201d; Karp was due to announce his decision on whether to charge an NYPD officer for shooting an unarmed black teenager a month earlier. And Karp was known for being on time. The district attorney was also known for his dislike of press conferences and the media in general. But he&#x2019;d had little choice this time. The streets had been roiling ever since the shooting. A young Asian police officer, Bryce Kim, claimed that the teenager, Ricky Watts, surprised him on the stairway of a tenement in Harlem and fired a gun at him. Kim shot the teen, who had then staggered down four flights of stairs before collapsing and dying outside the building.<br> <br>According to Vansand&#x2019;s sources at the NYPD, there was little hard evidence that a shot had been fired at the officer. No gun had been found on the teenager, nor had the crime scene investigators found a bullet or shell casing from any gun other than the officer&#x2019;s. Only the officer&#x2019;s partner and one elderly woman reported hearing two shots. A number of other witnesses, however, had come forward contending they&#x2019;d heard only a single shot. Even before the shooting, the city was tighter than a 42nd Street hooker&#x2019;s skirt. A week earlier, a police officer had been executed at a park in Harlem by members of a group calling itself the Nat Turner Revolutionary Brigade. That was when Vansand got his first call from someone who called himself &#x201c;Nat X,&#x201d; who then met with him in an abandoned building in Harlem and allowed his film crew to record his statement &#x201c;as the founder of the Brigade.&#x201d; Wearing a handkerchief to hide his face, and disguising his voice, the self-described revolutionary had declared that the shooting was &#x201c;a justified act in the war between the police and the black community.&#x201d;<br> <br>Needless to say, the police were on edge after that and so was the community. So when Ricky Watts was shot by Officer Kim, the scene at the shooting had threatened to explode into chaos. Agitators who arrived even before the ambulance had accused the police of, in the words of Mufti, &#x201c;a revenge assassination of an unarmed and innocent young black male&#x201d; in retribution for the cop&#x2019;s murder. It didn&#x2019;t help that the police who responded shortly afterward were looking to knock heads. Only the professionalism of their sergeants and commanders kept more violence from erupting.<br> <br>However, since then, several &#x201c;peaceful&#x201d; demonstrations organized by Mufti and others under the banner of the Black Justice Now movement had devolved into riots that included burned police cars and looted businesses, as well as assaults against police officers, the media, and onlookers. Mufti publicly decried the violence and called for restraint, but always with the caveat&#x2014;when the television cameras were rolling&#x2014;that ultimately the police were to blame for &#x201c;waging war on young black men.&#x201d;<br> <br>A week before today&#x2019;s press conference, the New York City Council&#x2014;of which Mufti was a member&#x2014;passed a resolution urging Karp to &#x201c;act with alacrity to right a terrible wrong that caused an innocent young man&#x2019;s senseless death and restore the public&#x2019;s trust in the New York Police Department and District Attorney&#x2019;s Office.&#x201d; Karp had responded through his spokesman that the &#x201c;officer-involved shooting&#x201d; was still being investigated and that no charges would be filed &#x201c;unless and until the evidence warrants it, and a grand jury has returned an indictment.&#x201d; The statement, or more accurately Mufti&#x2019;s denouncement of the statement, set off another round of violent protests.<br> <br>The national media, sensing a story that fit their narrative of out-of-control, racist police officers gunning down innocent black men, flocked to Gotham, and Mufti seized the moment. He&#x2019;d shrugged off his gentleman&#x2019;s agreement with Vansand and latched on to and further sensationalized the massive media circus response. Making the rounds, he&#x2019;d complained that Karp was stalling for time so as &#x201c;not to anger his friends in the New York Police Department, who want this to all blow over.&#x201d;<br> <br>Others in the Black Justice Now group had used even less restraint and accused the district attorney of plotting a cover-up with the NYPD brass. Nat X had arranged another interview with Vansand. &#x201c;The oppressors of the white state have carried out an open season of murder against black men. Therefore, they, and anyone who supports them, white or black, are legitimate targets of the Nat Turner Revolutionary Brigade.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if that wasn&#x2019;t enough, three police officers, including a lieutenant, had been arrested and charged with murdering one of Mufti&#x2019;s colleagues, Imani Sefu, and the attempted murder of Mufti himself. The reverend&#x2019;s clout with activists and the media nationwide had skyrocketed, and he was enjoying every minute of his near martyrdom.<br> <br>Vansand knew Karp was stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Even though he&#x2019;d moved swiftly to indict the officers, Mufti and others had been even quicker to exploit the accusations as proof that the system was racist and corrupt. And no matter what decision Karp reached regarding the Ricky Watts case, one side or the other was not going to like it, and the city would be rocked with violence and, perhaps, the further spilling of blood. But Vansand also saw it as a much-needed personal opportunity.<br> <br>Graduating college with a television journalism degree some twenty-five years ago, Vansand, whose real last name was Potts, had been tall and handsome in that innocuous television sameness, with a pleasant voice. He landed a job working as a weatherman for a station in Des Moines. Popular with female viewers, he&#x2019;d worked his way up from weatherman to weekend anchor to the daily evening news anchor, and he even won a regional Emmy for coverage of a tornado that had wiped out a small farm town. The actual reporting had been done by others, and he&#x2019;d just supplied the face and voice for the script. But it was enough to get the attention of RealNews, one of the big network television newsmagazines.<br> <br>RealNews had made him a star on the national scene, where he&#x2019;d become known for his &#x201c;ambush&#x201d; journalism and willingness to slant stories in whichever direction he perceived would give him the best ratings. But that was all in the past. He&#x2019;d fallen prey to the ravages of age, which moved at an accelerated pace in the TV news business. Seemingly overnight, he developed a paunch around his midsection and a wattle beneath his once firm chin that along with the puffiness under his eyes had resisted the best efforts of a plastic surgeon.<br> <br>Two years earlier, RealNews had let him go with a retirement party and the Rolex, which reminded him daily of when he&#x2019;d commanded that kind of money and prestige. He missed both, though he landed what most television desk jockeys would have considered a prime job with a New York City station. The owners hoped his name and former national prominence would result in better ratings, even if he was getting a little long in the tooth. They&#x2019;d created the &#x201c;Vansand Action Team&#x201d; that consisted mostly of himself and Escobar and dispatched him for &#x201c;special reports&#x201d; that ranged from hard news to that day&#x2019;s hot-dog-eating contest at Nathan&#x2019;s in Coney Island.<br> <br>He dreamed of the story that would get him back to the big time, where he could then fade gracefully to television news dotage. Like they do at 60 Minutes, he thought ruefully but with some hope. He firmly believed that could happen, now that the story was New York City on the brink of the worst riots since Los Angeles exploded in 1992 after the Rodney King decision. He knew he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to keep it all to himself; it was getting too big, and the national media, including RealNews, had more resources and time to devote to it. But he was determined to do whatever it took to stay out in front.<br> <br>Although he&#x2019;d been disappointed that Reverend Mufti had been about as loyal as a prostitute at a Shriner convention, it was no great surprise. But Vansand had something the other news teams didn&#x2019;t: Nat X. Several times since the Ricky Watts shooting he&#x2019;d called in advance to tell Vansand and Escobar where to position themselves for the best footage of the scripted violence that erupted during the protest marches. Just that morning, Nat X had told him that &#x201c;something big is going to go down at Karp&#x2019;s press conference.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d; Vansand had asked, thrilled at the insider information.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t going to tell you, my man,&#x201d; Nat X replied. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t trust no white man with that kind of information. But I got it set up for you. Make sure you take Oliver with you and keep the camera rolling on him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vansand had frowned. Oliver Gray was his intern, a young black journalism student at NYU whom Nat X had asked Vansand to take under his wing a week earlier. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the cousin of a friend of the female variety,&#x201d; Nat X had said, &#x201c;if you know what I mean. She&#x2019;s going to be grateful, I mean really grateful, if you do this for me. He&#x2019;ll act as a middleman between me and you, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Vansand had responded. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have an intern budgeted and I don&#x2019;t know if the station . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Figure it out, Pete,&#x201d; Nat X told him. Then his voice grew cold. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d consider it a personal favor, but if you can&#x2019;t do it, I&#x2019;m sure some other television station could use a bright young man like Oliver.&#x201d;<br> <br>So Vansand had met the young man at the station. Thin and scholarly-looking, Oliver Gray seemed nice enough. Well-spoken and polite. The station hadn&#x2019;t objected to Vansand taking on an unpaid intern, and Gray had tagged along with the Vansand Action Team all week.<br> <br>That morning when Vansand arrived, Gray was already waiting for him. The young man seemed excited and nervous at the same time. He repeated Nat X&#x2019;s promise that &#x201c;something big&#x201d; was going to happen at Karp&#x2019;s news conference. The newsman had gone into the morning&#x2019;s news-planning meeting crowing about the scoop he anticipated. But the news director insisted the team cover the hot-dog-eating contest first. &#x201c;We need something light between all the heavy stuff,&#x201d; the director, who wasn&#x2019;t even as old as Vansand&#x2019;s son by his second wife, said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to get back for the press conference.&#x201d;<br> <br>However, the director had not counted on a traffic jam coming back over the Brooklyn Bridge that had Vansand cursing as Escobar pulled up to the area of the street that had been cordoned off for the news vans. All the spots were taken, and a beefy traffic cop waved for them to keep moving even after Escobar pointed to the MEDIA sign in the front window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pull up to the joker, and I&#x2019;ll give him the old Pete Vansand charm,&#x201d; Vansand said.<br> <br>Escobar did as told. Rolling down his window, Vansand smiled at the cop. &#x201c;Hi, Officer, WZYN News here. We&#x2019;re a little late arriving, so can we squeeze in behind the other news vans?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No room, move on,&#x201d; said the man, whose name tag identified him as Officer McKinnon. &#x201c;You guys were all told to show up an hour ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about one for the home team? I&#x2019;m Pete Vansand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if you&#x2019;re the mayor of County Cork. Move along or I&#x2019;ll have your vehicle towed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Vansand swore. &#x201c;The press conference is about to start. Come on. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve seen me on the evening news and special reports by the Vansand Action Team.&#x201d;<br> <br>Officer McKinnon leaned over and studied Vansand&#x2019;s face as if seeing him clearly for the first time. He smiled, his Irish blue eyes twinkling. Vansand smiled back, relieved. But then the cop frowned and shook his head. &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve ever seen your mug,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re on the evening news? Well, I&#x2019;ll tell the missus when I get home tonight that I met a famous man. Now move along.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vansand slumped. &#x201c;Fucking moron,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was that, Pete, old buddy? Was there something you wanted to say to me?&#x201d; Officer McKinnon smiled again, only this time there was nothing friendly about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just saying what a paragon of the law you are,&#x201d; Vansand replied before turning back to Escobar. &#x201c;Oliver and I will get out here and take the camera. Go find a place to park and then come find me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d; Escobar asked, looking in the rearview mirror at the young intern, who was staring out at the crowd on the street. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s damn heavy. Plus the union won&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver can handle it,&#x201d; Vansand replied. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gray turned back toward the other two.

The dull light of a lantern flickered in the pilothouse, but little of it was visible from outside. Only a swath of yellow penetrated the shadows from the port cut into the iron to give the commander and the two river pilots a view ahead without being exposed to enemy fire. </p><p> <i>Arkansas</i> was a cumbersome vessel, ugly to the seaman accustomed to the sharp lines of a full-rigged sailing ship. Her main deck hardly cleared the water's surface, and the oak-and-iron-reinforced walls protecting the guns resembled a boxlike fort. In the darkness on the water below the diminutive heights of Haynes Bluff, her form loomed above the landing -- indistinct, like a small island merged with the shore. </p><p> The spring rains had come and gone, and with the onset of summer the water level of the river began to drop. Drawing fourteen feet, <i>Arkansas</i> was deep for work on a tributary of the Mississippi River. On each bank of the Yazoo rose a dense forest choked with briars and vines, and blowdown was piled high from the endless cycle of passing thunderstorms and annual inundation that temporarily spread an inland sea across the Mississippi flood plain. Overhanging branches might easily snag the smokestack, or one of the many shoals might easily trap the ironclad, making her a prize of any patrols sent from the two Union fleets anchored several hours away just above Vicksburg beyond DeSoto Point on the Mississippi River. </p><p> The nearly two hundred men down below, deep inside the ironclad, prepared for the battle to come as the ship's deckhands cast off the lines and the pilots muttered commands to the helmsman, who turned the wheel as directed. Orders were relayed via a tin speaking tube to the engineers on duty at the ship's two low-pressure steam engines. The 165-foot warship maneuvered away from the shore into midchannel, and started slowly downriver keeping just enough way on to maintain steerage in the current. Men moved about on the gundeck filling the tubs between the guns with fresh water for the sponges needed to swab the barrels after each shot, lest a lingering spark prematurely explode the next charge rammed home. </p><p> Other crewmen poured sand around the guns to soak up blood and help prevent the gunners and powder boys from slipping. They piled bandages and tourniquets at various locations while the surgeons below on the berth deck readied the surgery. The instruments -- scalpels, forceps, and saws -- shone brightly in the dim light. Down below, the churn of the ship's twin propellers was a dull roar. </p><p> In the aft section of the gundeck, Second Lieutenant Charles W. Read supervised the loading of the two six-inch stern rifles capable of firing exploding shells deadly to any wooden ship they might hit. The two gun crews under his command rammed home cartridge bags filled with powder, and followed them with wads and shells. When this was done, the gun captains plunged sharp metal picks down the vent holes at the breeches of the cannons to break open the powder bags. Primers and lanyards were made ready, and the guns were run out. The still air smelled of the river, dank and primal, of mud and ooze, and the heavy odor of the closely packed men, their sweat in the humid night darkening their uniforms and dampening their brows. </p><p> Standing near one of his guns, Read satisfied himself that his battery was ready for action, then leaned on the cannon and gazed out the gunport. He well understood what would come with the dawn -- the thrill and rush of war, the cries of the wounded, and the possibility that he might not live to see another day. He was already battle-hardened from bloody engagements on the upper and lower Mississippi River, and had learned under fire what he failed to at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. By all accounts of those who knew him, he was unafraid to fight. Rather than fearing war, he liked the excitement. </p><p> Read was a short man of slight build with a sharp, angular face adorned with a slender brown mustache and a goatee. A native of Satartia, Mississippi, a small town about twenty miles downriver from Yazoo City, he was soft-spoken and often taciturn, even when on liberty in the company of his fellow lieutenants, though he was fiercely loyal to his few friends. Like so many officers in the Confederate Navy, he resigned his commission in the Union Navy during the spring of 1861. His brief stint in the U.S. Navy, most of which he spent as a midshipman aboard the steam cruiser <i>Powhatan</i>, stationed in the Gulf of Mexico, provided him with few opportunities to better himself as an officer or to acquire important skills and knowledge of naval warfare. </p><p> Read's lackluster record at the Naval Academy in Annapolis likewise revealed nothing to indicate bright prospects as an officer in charge of ships and men in peacetime or in combat. He had taken his final examinations at Annapolis in June 1860, graduating at the age of twenty, and finishing last in his class of twenty-five cadets. During his liberal arts and military studies at the academy he racked up a prodigious number of demerits for fighting, profanity, failure to pass room inspection, and other infractions. His lack of discipline and his single-minded self-assurance came close to ending his naval career before it began. A classmate of his, Roswell H. Lamson, a lieutenant serving in the Union Navy, wrote that Read "was not considered very brilliant, but was one of those wiry, energetic fellows who would attempt anything but study." </p><p> Read's worst subject was French. No matter how hard he tried, he failed to master the language. The only word he could pronounce correctly was <i>savez</i>, a form of the verb "to know." He evidently took to saying it so often his classmates nicknamed him Savez. In fact, his close friends called him Savez throughout his life. </p><p> While Read may not have been a prime candidate as a French interpreter, he showed somewhat more promise in gunnery. He finished fourth from the bottom of his class in the theory of naval gunnery, a complex course of study involving voluminous charts, tables, and calculations required to figure accurate range, trajectory, and bearing for a target, the influence of windage, and, of course, a comprehensive overview of the various types of guns and projectiles found on typical warships of the day. However, when it came to actually firing cannons he exhibited a natural flair for the job. Big guns he could understand, and his instructors noticed and encouraged his affinity for them. </p><p> Of all the men aboard, Read was the only one with firsthand knowledge of what lay ahead of <i>Arkansas</i>. Several days past, under orders from his commander, Read had ridden hard across fifty miles of rugged terrain through the night to reach the stronghold of Vicksburg. Once there, he presented himself to Major General Earl Van Dorn. Read passed on his captain's concerns about the general's insistence that <i>Arkansas</i> should leave her easily defended position on the Yazoo to carry out the risky mission of attacking two Union fleets, then steam down the Mississippi and make for Mobile, destroying enemy gunboats along the way. Van Dorn listened to Read, but he did not change his mind. <i>Arkansas</i> would attack without delay and sink the enemy vessels gathered above Vicksburg or be blown up in the process. Infantry and cavalry charges against impossible odds were common in the land war, and thus far the Confederates had proven victorious in most such engagements. Van Dorn saw no reason not to apply similar tactics when it came to the ironclad. </p><p> In the company of another officer, Read rode up the east bank of the Mississippi above Vicksburg until he came within sight of the Union fleets. The undergrowth of the forest became so thick that he could ride no further. He crept to the river's edge on foot, and with a field glass surveyed the armada he and his shipmates aboard <i>Arkansas</i> would soon confront. The seagoing vessels of Admiral David G. Farragut were anchored in a line along Read's side of the river. </p><p> Read had fought Farragut's fleet during the battle of New Orleans the previous April, and he nursed a special grudge against one of the vessels, Gunboat Number Six. It was this ship that had fired a broadside into the CSS <i>McRea</i>, on which he had served as the executive officer. It was this ship that had killed his commander, Lieutenant Thomas B. Huger, a fair and brave man to whom he was devoted. Read later wrote that Huger was "an agreeable gentleman," adding that he was the sort of leader he wanted to serve under. Read watched patiently for a time, trying to see the telltale signs of smoke rising from the stacks of the wooden sloops of war. </p><p> Convinced that Farragut's ships did not have steam up, Read turned his attention to the ironclads and rams of Admiral Charles H. Davis anchored across the river from Farragut's fleet. Plumes of gray-and-black smoke rose from the stacks of most of Davis's ships. The smoke meant these ships had steam up and could get underway as soon as <i>Arkansas</i> hove into view. Of the two fleets, the ironclads and rams ranked as the most dangerous. They had fought their way down the Mississippi to destroy Confederate fortifications and capture cities, squeezing the Confederates from the north while Farragut did the same from the South in the Union's concerted effort to control all of the Mississippi and effectively cut the Confederacy in two. Vicksburg represented the last major Confederate fortress, a city with gun emplacements mounted on the heights above the river, and a series of defenses to protect its landward flanks. Read counted more than thirty large warships and support craft. Some of the mortar boats that had shelled forts Jackson and St. Philip, guarding the lower Mississippi before the fall of New Orleans, were also in the area. <i>Arkansas</i>'s mission appeared doomed from the start. </p><p> The hours passed in tense silence for the dozens of men crowded into the small confines of <i>Arkansas</i>'s gundeck, and for the others lined up below ready to pass cartridge bags, shot, and shells from the magazines along the passageways to the upper deck. The pilots worked the ship skillfully downriver, negotiating each twist and turn with care to stay in midchannel and avoid the shallows that made out from the points on the inside of bends. The first faint tinges of daylight cast the open gunports in dark blue. Soon, the men could make out the features along the shoreline as the sun rose and the warship approached the lower Yazoo. </p><p> "Daylight found us seven or eight miles above the mouth of the river," Read later wrote in his <i>Reminiscences of the Confederate States Navy</i>. "The morning was warm and perfectly calm; the dense volume of black smoke which issued from our funnel, rose high above the trees, and we knew that the enemy would soon be on the lookout for us. Pretty soon we discovered smoke above the trees below, winding along the course of the crooked Yazoo." </p><p> Three Union warships steamed fast upriver on a reconnaissance mission. The USS <i>Carondelet</i>, an ironclad mounting thirteen guns, was the most powerful. <i>Tyler</i>, a side-wheeler with eight guns, and the ram <i>Queen of the West</i> supported her. The rebel vessel came into view. The lookouts noted that she looked chocolate, rather than black, due to the patina of rust on her iron plating. The armor reinforcing her timber casemate was nothing more than railroad iron hastily fitted in place, along with boiler plate. She looked like a great brown monster pushing up a bow wave of murky river water. </p><p> The distance between the opposing vessels closed. <i>Tyler</i>, the leading ship, fired her bow guns. Carondelet followed. The deafening impacts of the shells smashing against <i>Arkansas</i>'s forward casemate shook the ship and sent shards of iron from her shield whizzing aft. More shot and shells hit, and the iron began to warp and bend. When her guns came to bear, <i>Arkansas</i> returned fire. A shell ripped through <i>Tyler</i> and exploded in the engine room, spraying the compartment in blood and gore from the dead and wounded. The Union ships turned back toward the Mississippi. They chose a running fight that would bring the rebel ironclad between the massed guns of the two Union fleets, where it was supposed she would be quickly destroyed. </p><p> The roar of cannons, the shriek of shells, and the tremendous explosions from each direct hit rumbled through the countryside. The noise of the cannonading could be heard more than ten miles away. Smoke drifted across the water, and created an unnatural fog that seemed to hang in the still air and spread slowly to each bank of the Yazoo. Both Union and Confederate crews took casualties, the men of <i>Carondelet</i> receiving the worst of it with approximately thirty killed, wounded, or missing at the close of the engagement. <i>Queen of the West</i>, after ineffectual attempts to ram <i>Arkansas</i>, steamed away with all speed, though damaged from several well-aimed projectiles. </p><p> Read described in vivid detail the destruction of <i>Carondelet</i>: </p><p><br> We had decreased our distance from the iron-clad rapidly, and were only a hundred yards astern, our shot still raking him, when he ceased firing and sheered into the bank; our engines were stopped, and ranging up alongside, with the muzzles of our guns touching him, we poured in a broadside of solid shot, when his colors came down....on we pushed, driving the two fleeing boats ahead of us, our speed decreasing all the time, owing to shot holes in the smoke stack; but in a few minutes the "Arkansas" glided out into the broad Mississippi, right into the midst of the hostile fleet. </p><p><br> In addition to casualties among the crew, <i>Arkansas</i> had sustained serious damage. Holes riddled the smokestack, reducing the flow of air available to efficiently fire the boilers. The connection between the funnel and the furnaces had been shot to pieces, and flames from the furnaces heated the gundeck. The temperature inside the ship rose to above 120 degrees, steam pressure decreased, and the ironclad's propellers turned more slowly every minute. </p><p> As <i>Arkansas</i> emerged from the Yazoo, the engines could hardly keep her moving fast enough to maintain steerage in the swift river current. Her captain, who had been wounded, nevertheless kept to his post. He ordered her turned downriver toward the safety of Vicksburg. In the brief interlude before the next battle, he observed the "forest of masts and smokestacks" and the "panoramic effect...intensified by the city of men spread out with innumerable tents opposite on the right bank." The Union fleets were not ready to get underway and the men aboard the ships rushed to bring their guns to bear. One of the first to slip her cable and close in was Gunboat Number Six. </p><p> Manning his station at the bow guns, Lieutenant George W. Gift recognized the ship. ...</p></p><h2>Women of Brewster Place</h2><p>Once the home of poor Irish and Italian immigrants, Brewster Place, a rotting tenement on a dead-end street, now shelters black families. This novel portrays the courage, the fear, and the anguish of some of the women there who hold their families together, trying to make a home. Among them are: Mattie Michael, the matriarch who loses her son to prison; Etta Mae Johnson who tries to trade the &#39;high life&#39; for marriage with a local preacher; Kiswana Browne who leaves her middle-class family to organize a tenant&#39;s union.</p><p><b>Gloria Naylor</b>&nbsp;(1950-2016) grew up in New York City. She received her B.A. in English from Brooklyn College and her M.A. in Afro-American Studies from Yale University. Her first novel, <i>The Women of Brewster Place</i>, won the National Book Award for first fiction in 1983. She is also the author of <i>Linden Hills </i>(available from Penguin), <i>Mama Day</i>, <i>Bailey's Cafe</i>, and <i>The Men of Brewster Place</i>.This new, slightly abridged audio version of The Women of Brewster Place is a good rendition of Naylor's 1982 debut novel, which won a National Book Award. Tonya Pinkins reads and presents the characters very well, catching the lyricism of each woman's story; the range of emotions is a demanding task, and Pinkins responds creatively and sensitively. The recording length captures the essence of Naylor's seven stories, but for those who know the book, this abridgment doesn't fully capture the power of the whole or the full devastation and pride of Naylor's characters. The program will have to be repackaged as the original box won't withstand much handling.

A routine cell phone upgrade left author James Rebanks with a pretty decent camera and a pre-loaded Twitter app--the tools to share his way of life with the world. And what began as a tentative experiment became an international phenomenon.<br>James has worked the land for years, as did his father, and his father before him. His family has lived and farmed in the Lake District of Northern England as long as there have been written records (since 1420) and possibly much longer. And while the land itself has inspired great poets and authors we have rarely heard from the people who tend it. One Twitter account has changed all that, and now James Rebanks has broken free of the 140-character limit and produced "the book I have wanted to write my whole life."&nbsp;<i>The Shepherd's Life </i>is a memoir about growing up amidst a magical, storied landscape, of coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s among hills that seem timeless, and yet suffused with history. Broken into the four seasons, the book chronicles the author's daily experiences at work with his flock and brings alive his family and their ancient way of life, which at times can seem irreconcilable with the modern world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An astonishing original work,&nbsp;<i>The Shepherd's Life</i> is an intimate look from inside a seemingly ordinary life, one that celebrates the meaning of place, the ties of family to the land around them, and the beauty of the past. It is the untold story of the Lake District, of a people who exist and endure out of sight in the midst of the most iconic literary landscape in the world.</p><p>JAMES REBANKS runs a family-owned farm in the Lake District in northern England.

For the next ten years, Hornby&#x2019;s incandescently funny Stuff I&#x2019;ve Been Reading&#x201d; chronicled a singular reading life one that is measured not just in books bought&#x201d; and books read,&#x201d; as each column begins, but in the way our feelings toward Celine Dion say a lot about who we are, the way Body Shop Vanilla Shower Gel can add excitement to our days, and the way John Updike might ruin our sex lives. Hornby&#x2019;s column is both an impeccable, wide-ranging reading list and an indispensable reminder of why we read.<br></p><p>Ten years ago when his &#x201c;Stuff I&#x2019;ve Been Reading&#x201d; column debuted with <em>The Believer</em>, Nick Hornby instantly became one of our most persuasive contemporary champions for the pleasures of the (examined) reading life. Unlike critical reviewers who tend to feign objectivity, Hornby abandons pretense--except in the service of jokes, and in reluctant adherence to <em>The Believer</em>&#x2019;s snark-free code&#x2014;and relates his authentic experiences with books, those bought aspirationally and immediately shelved, and those he&#x2019;s read. He frames his experience of books in what&#x2019;s going on in his life, which albums he&#x2019;s playing, what&#x2019;s going on with his son, how much he even feels like reading (which, especially in football season, can be not so much). He occasionally laments his ruts and takes wild stabs at unexplored genres, but his natural interests swing widely enough to include frequent surprises. He&#x2019;ll put (or throw) down anything he deems dull, exhorting writers to cut the boring bits--like the random childhood anecdotes that can plague biographies: &#x201c;Please, biographers. Please, please, please. Have mercy. Select for us. We have jobs, kids, DVD players, season tickets. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we don&#x2019;t want to know about stuff.&#x201d; As I read, my wish list inevitably swelled, but it wasn&#x2019;t the books themselves that made this one such good reading: for bibliophiles, Hornby is excellent company--discriminating but admiring, with brilliant, often hilarious insight into why some books work wonderfully, while others stumble on one sloppy detail and unravel their own fabric. Even if I never read many of the books he recommends with such zeal, I loved every vicarious page. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><b>Nick Hornby</b> is the author of six novels, the most recent of which is <i>Juliet, Naked</i>, and a memoir, <i>Fever Pitch</i>.

At this time Pissarro, like Monet, started to work on canvases in series, ofthen pointing several simultaneously and discarding one temporarily when the light, the weather or his mood altered. He started all of them at the scene and worked with extraordinary speed and deftness. In this book, the authors set Pissarro&#39;s cityscapes in their broad art-historical context, looking also at contemporary treatments of the urban scene by Vuillard, Bonnard and Toulouse-Lautrec. Using Pissarro&#39;s extensive correspondence from this period, they reveal the artist&#39;s own attitude towards his final works. The book includes a catatogue of Pissarro&#39;s urban series, each one introduced by an overview covering the history of the cityscape pictured and the production, exhibition history and early critical reception of the series. This book is the catalogue for an exhibition of Pissarro&#39;s cityscape paintings at the Dallas Museum of Art (November 15, 1992 - January 31, 1993). The exhibition will then be shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from March 7 to June 6, 1993 and at the Royal Academy in London from July 2 to October 10, 1993.</p><p>The catalog of an exhibition traveling to Dallas, Philadelphia, and London in 1992-93, this book considers approximately 150 paintings done by Pissarro (1830-1903) in the last decade of his life. These paintings are repeated meditations on various motifs in Paris, Rouen, Dieppe, and Le Havre. Brettell (director, Dallas Museum of Art) places Pissarro in the urban view-painting tradition, while Joachim Pissarro, a descendant of the artist, relates these pictures to the artist's development and attempts to understand his intent in painting series. Graced by beautiful plates, this book is appropriate for both lay readers and specialists.<br><i>- Jack Perry Brown, Art Inst. of Chicago Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>London War Notes, 1939-1945</h2><p>this curious hush-hush war</p><p></p><h2>The Titanic: An Interactive History Adventure (You Choose: History)</h2><p>YOU are aboard the Titanic, the world&#x2019;s largest ocean liner.

St Peter made this book short and simple, yet packed into it &#34;all that is necessary to know about prayer.&#34; It is full of saintly counsels on prayer, which is the key to the entire spiritual life. The reader of the Treatise will access the classic Catholic wisdom on mental prayer, including what to think about, how to follow a method, when to disregard a method, the importance of the heart over the head, what to do in times of spiritual dryness and much more. This introduces souls to mental prayer as a means of obtaining all spiritual goods. St. Peter of Alcantara was a 16th - century Spaniard and a spiritual director of St. Teresa of Avila, the great Doctor of Prayer. He was known for his severe penances and after he died, he is said to have appeared to St. Teresa and exclaimed: &#34;O blessed penance that has led me to Heaven!&#34;</p><p>St. Peter of Alcantara was born at Alcantara, Spain of noble descent in 1499. When he was fourteen, he was sent to the University of Salamanca, and enrolled with the Franciscans in 1515. After founding a new community of the Stricter Observance for Badajoz, he became a priest in 1524, and his preaching afterwards was met with great success. St. Peter often went into spiritual ecstasy and levitation, but he also found the time to compose various spiritually-based letters, and his <i>Treatise on Prayer and Meditation</i> was published by TAN in 2009. He also served as spiritual director for St. Teresa of Avila and was able to work miracles. He died while kneeling on the eighteenth of October, 1562, and was canonized in 1669 by Pope Clement IX.<br></p><h2>The Evil Hours: A Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2><p><b>In the tradition of <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> and <i>The Noonday Demon</i>, a moving, eye-opening exploration of PTSD</b>&nbsp;Just as polio loomed over the 1950s, and AIDS stalked the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, posttraumatic stress disorder haunts us in the early years of the twenty-first century. Over a decade into the United States&#x2019; &#x201c;global war on terror,&#x201d; PTSD afflicts as many as 30 percent of the conflict&#x2019;s veterans. But the disorder&#x2019;s reach extends far beyond the armed forces. In total, some twenty-seven million Americans are believed to be PTSD survivors. Yet to many of us, the disorder remains shrouded in mystery, secrecy, and shame.<p>Now, David J. Morris &#x2014; a war correspondent, former Marine, and PTSD sufferer himself &#x2014; has written the essential account of this illness. Through interviews with individuals living with PTSD, forays into the scientific, literary, and cultural history of the illness, and memoir, Morris crafts a moving work that will speak not only to those with the condition and to their loved ones, but also to all of us struggling to make sense of an anxious and uncertain time.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>HMH hardcover, 2015; previous ISBN 978-0-544-08661-6&#x201c;David J.

Shortly after his arrival in Uganda, he is called to the scene of a bizarre car accident: Idi Amin, manically driving his red Maserati down the dirt tracks of Garrigan's small village, has run over a cow. Garrigan binds Amin's sprained wrist and puts the incident behind him, until a letter arrives from the Minister of Health informing him that Amin--in his obsession with all things Scottish--has ap-pointed Garrigan his personal physician. Garrigan is instructed to settle into State House, on the grounds of Amin's residence, immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Later, Garrigan will reflect that had he known what awaited him, had he foreseen the terrifying concatenation of events this decision would set in motion, he would have boarded the first plane back to Scotland. He will wonder why it never occurred to him to simply say no. But--flattered, disarmed, and intrigued, if uneasily, by the pros-pect of entering Amin's inner circle--he steps into the role of caring for the man who will turn out to be one of the most brutal dictators of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>So begins Nick Garrigan's journey into a Con-radian heart of darkness, as his own moral center<br>battles weakly against, and then succumbs to, the dark and irresistible seductions of Idi Amin Dada, whose cruelty and cunning are masked by brilliant rhetoric, hilarious wit, and electrifying personal magnetism. When at last Nick awakens to the horrors of Amin's regime, he must awaken also to his own complicity in it--he cared for Amin, as a doctor and as a friend--and to the knowledge that he is both a traitor to his own country and a prisoner in his new one. By turns comic and chilling, Giles Foden's The Last King of Scotland is a masterful debut from a remarkable talent--a riveting history of "blood, misery and foolishness" that lingers in the mind long after the last page is turned, and a profound meditation on conscience, charisma, and the slow corruption of the human heart.</p><p>No, we're not talking Bonnie Prince Charlie here. The title character of Giles Foden's debut novel, <i>The Last King of Scotland</i>, is none other than Idi Amin, the former dictator of Uganda. Told from the viewpoint of Nicholas Garrigan, Amin's personal physician, the novel chronicles the hell that was Uganda in the 1970s. Garrigan, the only son of a Scots Presbyterian minister, finds himself far away from Fossiemuir when he accepts a post with the Ministry of Health in Uganda. His arrival in Kampala coincides with the coup that leads to President Obote's overthrow and Idi Amin Dada's ascendancy to power. Garrigan spends only a few days in the capital city, however, before heading out to his assignment in the bush. But a freak traffic accident involving Amin's sports car and a cow eventually brings the good doctor into the dictator's orbit; a few months later, Garrigan is recalled from his rural hospital and named personal physician to the president. Soon enough, Garrigan finds himself caught between his duty to his patient and growing pressure from his own government to help them control Amin.<p> From Nicholas Garrigan's catbird seat, Foden guides us through the horrors of Amin's Uganda. It would be simple enough to make the dictator merely monstrous, but Foden defies expectation, rendering him appealing even as he terrifies. The doctor "couldn't help feeling awed by the sheer size of him and the way, even in those unelevated circumstances, he radiated a barely restrained energy.... I felt--far from being the healer--that some kind of elemental force was seeping into me." And Garrigan makes a fine stand-in for Conrad's Marlow as he travels up a river of blood from naivet� to horrified recognition of his own complicity. As if this weren't enough, Foden also treats us to a finely drawn portrait of Africa in all its natural, political, and social complexity. <i>The Last King of Scotland</i> makes for dark but compelling reading. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Giles Foden was born in England in 1967. As a child he moved with his family to Africa, where they lived in various countries until 1993. He was an editor of the Times Literary Supplement be-fore joining the staff of the Guardian. He lives in London.</p><h2>The Happiest Man in the World: An Account of the Life of Poppa Neutrino</h2><p><i>The Happiest Man in the World</i> buoyantly describes seventy-four-year-old David Pearlman, a restless and migratory soul, a mariner, a musician, a member of the Explorers Club and a friend of the San Francisco Beats, a former preacher and sign painter, a polymath, a pauper, and a football strategist for the Red Mesa Redskins of the Navajo Nation. When Pearlman was fifty, he was bitten on the hand by a dog in Mexico and for two years got so sick that he thought he would die. When he recovered, he felt so different that he decided he needed a new name. He began calling himself Poppa Neutrino, after the itinerant particle that is so small it can hardly be detected. To Neutrino, the particle represents the elements of the hidden life that assert themselves discreetly.<br><br>Inspired by Thor Heyerdahl and Kon-Tiki, Neutrino is the only man ever to build a raft from garbage he found on the streets of New York and sail it across the North Atlantic. <br>The<i> </i>New York <i>Daily News</i> described the accomplishment as &#x201c;the sail of the century.&#x201d; <i>National Geographic </i>broadcast an account of the trip as part of its series on extreme adventures. And now he is on a quest to cross the Pacific on a raft. If he makes it, he plans to continue around the world. No one has ever sailed around the world on a raft. Meanwhile, he has invented the Neutrino Clock Offense, an unstoppable football play, which a former coach of the New York Jets describes as being as innovative as the forward pass.<br><br>The philosophical underpinnings of Neutrino&#x2019;s existence are what he calls Triads, a concept worked out after years of reading and reflection. He believes that each person, to be truly happy, must define his or her three deepest desires and pursue them remorselessly. Freedom, Joy, and Art are Neutrino&#x2019;s three.<br><i>The Happiest Man in the World</i> is a lavish, exotic, funny, and deeply serious book about a man who has led a life of profound engagement and ceaseless adventure.</p><p>Alec Wilkinson has been a writer at <i>The New Yorker </i>since 1980. Before that he was a policeman in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, and before that he was a rock and roll musician. He lives with his wife and son in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> Over the last few years, Wilkinson (<i>Mr. Apology and Other Essays</i>) has been spending quite a bit of time in the company of "Poppa Neutrino," a homeless man who's performed as a street musician in New Orleans and New York and traveled across the Atlantic in a homemade raft. So "lavish and prodigal" is Neutrino's history that his barroom encounters with Kerouac and Ginsberg at the height of the beat era are dispensed with in a few sentences&#x2014;after all, by that time, he'd already been crisscrossing the country for several years himself. In Wilkinson's company, Neutrino spends time in Arizona trying to persuade football coaches to use a passing play he's developed that could conceivably revolutionize the offensive game, winding up on a Navajo reservation where he volunteers with a high school team. Then it's off to Mexico, where he puts the finishing touches on one more raft, which he hopes to sail down the coast to South America and then across the Pacific. For the most part, Wilkinson simply observes, acting as our conduit to this abrasively compelling personality. But that's like saying Boswell was simply observing Johnson: the portrait of Neutrino that emerges from these encounters and anecdotes is a truly captivating story. <i>(Mar. 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although it contains brief information on rose cultivation and a scattering of features on such subjects as the rose in music, the heart of the book is the three alphabetical sections describing individual roses. The author uses the 1979 classification of the World Federation of Rose Societies; his main categories are wild roses, modern and old garden roses grouped together, and miniatures. Each entry includes a color photograph; information on the rose's history, cultivation, and parentage; and whether it is repeat flowering or fragrant. Roses are listed according to the name under which they were first released; the index provides access by later names. Beautiful to look at, this book will be most useful to readers looking for more information about varieties than is provided in growers' catalogs.

The author of over twenty books, including <i>Naomi</i> (1924), <i>Some Prefer Nettles</i> (1928), <i>Arrowroot</i> (1931), and <i>A Portrait of Shunkin</i> (1933), Tanizaki also published translations of the Japanese classic, <i>The Tale of Genji</i> in 1941, 1954, and 1965. Several of his novels, including <i>Quicksand</i> (1930), <i>The Key</i> (1956), and <i>Diary of a Mad Old Man</i> (1961) were made into movies.

During his stay, he amassed the largest collection of Tibetan texts, art, and artifacts in the Western hemisphere at that time. He also documented, in both still photography and 16mm film, the age-old civilization of Tibet on the eve of its destruction by Chinese Communists. <br><br>Based on thousands of primary sources and rare archival materials, <i>Theos Bernard, the White Lama</i> recounts the real story behind the purported adventures of this iconic figure and his role in the growth of America's religious counterculture. Over the course of his brief life, Bernard met, associated, and corresponded with the major social, political, and cultural leaders of his day, from the Regent and high politicians of Tibet to saints, scholars, and diplomats of British India, from Charles Lindbergh and Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Gandhi and Nehru. Although hailed as a brilliant pioneer by the media, Bernard also had his flaws. He was an entrepreneur propelled by grandiose schemes, a handsome man who shamelessly used his looks to bounce from rich wife to rich wife in support of his activities, and a master manipulator who concocted his own interpretation of Eastern wisdom to suit his ends. Bernard had a bright future before him, but disappeared in India during the communal violence of the 1947 Partition, never to be seen again.<br><br>Through diaries, interviews, and previously unstudied documents, Paul G.

Jungians hold that development of the self occurs as one passes through the four archetypal patterns of static feminine, dynamic masculine, static masculine, and dynamic feminine. If one becomes fixated on one of the archetypes, problems ranging from passive aggression to psychoses can result. For the lay reader, Hill begins with a concise description of the dynamics of the Jungian archetypes and continues with patterns of normal and abnormal development and treatment. Later chapters on clinical supervision and an integrated model for depth psychology are aimed at the clinician. The book is extensively referenced and includes both case studies and archetypical examples from classical and modern times. Given the current interest in the psychology of men and women, this book will be useful to both academic and public libraries.<br><i>- Jennifer Amador, Central State Hosp .

How is that a pioneering woman, working in male-dominated fields, without sponsors or credentials, could accomplish more than so many more celebrated and professionally educated men could manage? How can we all unlock the wisdom of the world simply by paying close attention? <br><br>With their intelligence and acute insight into other cultures and species, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's many books have won a wide and loving audience. In <i>A Million Years with You</i>, this legendary author shares stories from her life, showing how a formative experience in South West Africa (now Namibia) in the 1950s taught her how to pay attention to the ancient wisdom of animals and humankind.<br><br>As a young woman, Marshall Thomas joined her family on an anthropological expedition to the Kalahari Desert, where she conducted fieldwork among the Ju/wa Bushmen, later publishing her findings as <i>The Harmless People</i>. After college, a wedding, and the birth of two children, she returned to Uganda shortly before Idi Amin's bloody coup. Her skills as an observer and a writer would be put to the test on many other occasions working with dogs, cats, cougars, deer&#x2014;and with more personal struggles. <i>A Million Years with You</i> is a powerful memoir from a pioneering woman, an icon of American letters.<br></p><p>"Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's affirming, finely observed memoir recounts a life in the process of being fully and unapologetically lived; a gift from someone with an endlessly curious mind and more than eight decades on the planet.

His followers invited Him into their personal spaces, and He blessed them, healed them, and performed miracles for them.So it is today. When we invite Jesus into our homes, we will also be blessed and healed and see miracles.

She writes, &#39;&#39;Maybe you could set aside one night every month for your family to discuss an attribute of Jesus Christ and a lesson He taught within someone&#39;s home.

Tying her to the bed and blindfolding her, he indulged in a little knife play, destroyed the bedroom, and raped her repeatedly.<br>For Brattleboro police lieutenant Joe Gunther, the case cuts deep: the victim is his long-time lover and best friend, Gail Zigman, and the attack took place in the very bed he left just a few hours earlier.<br>The leafy streets, sweet with earthy scents of the nearby Vermont hills, yield a sour trail of unsavory clues, all pointing to vagrant handyman and ex-con Bob Vogel. With three rapes already to his name, it looks as if he's been at it again.<br>But appearances can lead to assumptions, and although Vogel runs for cover as soon as he's approached by the police, Joe cannot ignore the nagging feeling that something is amiss. Risking his friendship with Gail, the respect of his peers, and finally his own life, Joe doggedly keeps on the trail, trying to find out if the evidence against Vogel is genuine, or tainted...what policemen call "fruits of the poisonous tree."</p><p><p>Archer Mayor is the author of the highly acclaimed Vermont-based series featuring detective Joe Gunther, which the <i> Chicago Tribune </i> describes as &#x201c;the best police procedurals being written in America.&#x201d; He is a past winner of the New England Independent Booksellers Association Award for Best Fiction&#x2015;the first time a writer of crime literature has been so honored. In 2011, Mayor&#x2019;s 22nd Joe Gunther novel, TAG MAN, earned a place on <i> The New York Times </i> bestseller list for hardback fiction. </p><p> Before turning his hand to fiction, Mayor wrote history books, the most notable of which, <i> Southern Timberman: The Legacy of William Buchanan, </i> concerned the lumber and oil business in Louisiana from the 1870s to the 1970s. This book was published in 1988 and very well received; it was republished as a trade paperback in 2009. </p><p> Archer Mayor is a death investigator for Vermont&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a detective for the Windham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, the publisher of his own backlist, a travel writer for AAA, and he travels the Northeast giving speeches and conducting workshops. He has 25 years of experience as a volunteer firefighter/EMT. Mayor was brought up in the US, Canada and France and had been employed as a scholarly editor, a researcher for TIME-LIFE Books, a political advance-man, a theater photographer, a newspaper writer/editor, a lab technician for <i> Paris-Match Magazine </i> in Paris, France, and a medical illustrator. In addition to writing novels and occasional articles, Mayor gives talks and workshops all around the country, including the Bread Loaf Young Writers conference in Middlebury, Vermont, and the Colby College seminar on forensic sciences in Waterville, Maine. </p><p> Mayor&#x2019;s critically-acclaimed series of police novels feature Lt. Joe Gunther of the Brattleboro, Vermont, police department. The books, which have been appearing about once a year since 1988, have been published in five languages (if you count British), and routinely gather high praise from such sources as <i>The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New Yorker,</i> and others, often appearing on their &#x201c;ten best&#x201d; yearly lists. </p><p> Whereas many writers base their books only on interviews and scholarly research, Mayor&#x2019;s novels are based on actual experience in the field. The result adds a depth, detail and veracity to his characters and their tribulations that has led <i>The New York Times</i> to call him &#x201c;the boss man on procedures&#x201d;.</p><p>To set the stage: In pursuit of a man believed to have raped Gail Zigman &#x2013; Bob Vogel &#x2013; Joe has been stabbed in the stomach, and now lies near death in the hospital.</p> <p>What I remember comes to me in private mental snapshots-some slightly fuzzy or badly framed, some of people, others of ceilings, ambulance roofs, or views of the sky. All of them are in random order. The one constant theme, like music accompanying a slide show, is the pain. It is the pain, I&#x2019;ve come to think, that stimulated my taking the snapshots in the first place. Whenever it hit badly enough, I came into focus, more or less, just as a dozing concertgoer might be jarred awake by an occasional off-key note, before nodding off once more.</p> <p>There are many clear, full face, but troubled portraits of friends-Tony, Ron, Sammie, Gail, Billy... even my younger brother Leo, a butcher from Thetford and the gentle custodian of the remnants of my family. All there, I knew, to lend me comfort, to see how I&#x2019;m doing, but all looking as if they&#x2019;ve lost their best friend. There is one of Willy, of course, that&#x2019;s a little different. He&#x2019;s farther away, standing straight and viewing from a distance. When I wasn&#x2019;t taking photos but just leafing through them until the next spasm woke me up &#x2013; I came to think he was looking at me as he might a dead dog in the street. But then he&#x2019;s a special case; and he did show up.</p> <p>Toward the end, more lucid, although still keeping to myself in dark unconsciousness, I knew that&#x2019;s what was going on-that they were visiting me-fitting themselves awkwardly in between the IV poles, the electronic monitors, the EKG machine, and a bunch of other equipment that kept a steady watch on me. But having no memory of their visits apart from these disjointed images-and judging solely from their expressions-I knew I wasn&#x2019;t doing too well.</p> <p>I eventually found that out for myself when the familiar painful stimulus led to a moving picture instead of a still. I watched in grimacing fascination as a young nurse, her eyes watchful, manipulated something below my line of sight. It was dark all around us, the only light coming from a freestanding gooseneck lamp she had beside her, and the familiar green, red, and amber glow from the various instruments plugged in all around me.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ow.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stopped, and turned to look at me, her face darkening in the shadow, which in turn highlighted the whiteness of her teeth as she smiled. &#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;</p> <p>I moved my head slightly to take in the surrounding gloom. &#x201c;Morning?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Figure of speech. It&#x2019;s two A.M. How are you feeling?&#x201d; Her voice was soft and clear.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not too good. What are you doing down there?&#x201d; To me, my voice sounded like it was coming from inside an echo chamber and my throat hurt like hell. I didn&#x2019;t know if I was whispering or shouting.</p> <p>&#x201c;Changing your dressing. Sorry if it hurts a bit.&#x201d;</p> <p>I caught my breath at an extra jolt, remembering how painlessly the knife had slipped in. &#x201c;He did a hell of a job, I guess.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled again, her eyes back on what she was doing. &#x201c;That he did. He said lots of other people would&#x2019;ve died from less. You&#x2019;re a tough guy, Mr. Gunther.&#x201d;</p> <p>She hadn&#x2019;t known whom I&#x2019;d meant, and I was too tired to explain it to her. Also, there was something uplifting in the way she spoke, after all those grim-faced snapshots, and I didn&#x2019;t want to ruin the mood. I passed out instead, launched on a new career of collecting movie loops-small segments of action, usually of nurses like her, sometimes of doctors-always brought on by the pain. Some of these loops had dialog, occasionally as coherent and reasonable as that first one, but they tended to be a little repetitive. The time of day and concern for how I was feeling were two popular subjects. And there were other times when the movie and the soundtrack were completely out of whack, when lips moved without sound and words floated by out of context. I got more of those grim looks at those times, and eventually, like a precocious toddler, I learned to keep my mouth shut when the audience frowned.</p> <p>A breakthrough came when I woke not from pain, but from a gentle pressure on my forehead-something warm and smooth-a caress-and I opened my eyes to see Gail looking down at me.</p> <p>&#x201c;Smile,&#x201d; I asked her.</p> <p>She smiled-genuinely-the pleasure reaching the small crinkles near her eyes. &#x201c;Hi. You&#x2019;re looking better.&#x201d;</p> <p>I waited for the pain, for the lights to fade and the movie to end as usual-some of them had been that short-but nothing happened. I took advantage of it to study her more closely, in the flesh, instead of in the recesses of my mind. She didn&#x2019;t look better. Her eyes were bloodshot, her hair tangled and unwashed, and her cheeks gaunt and shadowed with exhaustion.</p> <p>&#x201c;You look terrible.&#x201d;</p> <p>The smile spread to a chuckle. &#x201c;Thanks a lot-you&#x2019;re to blame for most of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>I felt a familiar tug on my ability to focus-my brain longing to return to its black hole of peaceful contemplation. My sight darkened and blurred. But I didn&#x2019;t want to go this time. I shifted my weight slightly, and the hot poker did the rest-my eyes cleared and my mind resurfaced.</p> <p>That obviously wasn&#x2019;t all it did, however. Gail suddenly leaned forward, her expression intent. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>I unclenched my teeth. &#x201c;Yeah-sorry.&#x201d; I raised an arm to touch her, to set her at ease, and saw a thin, almost bony hand come into view-pale, slightly wrinkled, and scarred by several old IV sites along the forearm. Instead of squeezing her shoulder, I flexed my hand several times, as if at a loss to explain its function.</p> <p>She interpreted the gesture. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been here a long time, Joe. Weeks. You came close to dying a few times.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her tightly controlled voice suddenly meshed with her ravaged appearance and I felt terrible about my earlier flip comment. I put the stranger&#x2019;s hand to use and gripped her arm. &#x201c;Gail, I thought about you-about being with you-just after he stabbed me.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled again. &#x201c;Swell.&#x201d;</p> <p>I held onto her harder. &#x201c;No. It was strange. It was peaceful, and didn&#x2019;t hurt. I was just lying there in the water, thinking of how nice it would be to be with you. You were the one thing I could think of that helped.&#x201d;</p> <p>The words sounded awkward to me, unfamiliar and slightly juvenile. I was angered at my own lack of eloquence, knowing without being told of the hours she must have spent by my bed, putting aside her own pain so she could accompany me through mine.</p> <p>&#x201c;I guess it worked,&#x201d; was what she said, but the smile lingered in her eyes.</p> <p>I wanted to ask her how she was doing, if her own suffering at the hand of our mutual nemesis had eased any since we&#x2019;d last visited. I wanted to find out what had happened to Bob Vogel, and what her reaction was to that. But it was all beyond me. My vision closed in again, I saw my hand fall away from her arm, and this time I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to move. Just as I shut down, I saw Gail lean forward to kiss me.</p> <p>The next visitor I knew about was Leo, my brother, who woke me up as any truly professional butcher might-by getting a firm grip on the meat of my upper arm.</p> <p>He smiled as I opened my eyes. &#x201c;Jesus, Joey, you&#x2019;re scrawnier&#x2019;n hell.&#x201d;</p> <p>I focused on his tired face-broader and darker than Gail&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look so hot yourself,&#x201d; I croaked, clearing my throat.</p> <p>He slipped his arm behind my neck and tilted my head up to receive some cool water from a cup with a bent straw hanging out of it-his years of tending our invalid mother showing in his gentle dexterity. &#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d want some of this-all that crap they had stuffed down your throat. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;</p> <p>I finished sipping and he laid me back, suddenly peeling back my upper lip and looking at my teeth. &#x201c;Boy, we ought to do something about that, too. I brought a toothbrush, okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>I stared in wordless amazement at the brush he whipped out of his shirt pocket, his tired eyes gleaming with the bright glow of success. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s another thing I knew they wouldn&#x2019;t think of. Has Gail tried to kiss you yet?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t... I think so. I&#x2019;ve been kind of groggy.&#x201d;</p> <p>He burst out laughing and produced a crumpled tube from another pocket, from which he slathered a thick dollop onto the brush. &#x201c;God, no wonder she hasn&#x2019;t said much-must still be catching her breath.&#x201d;</p> <p>I blinked a couple of times, trying to banish the tendrils of a deep sleep from my brain. &#x201c;Leo, what&#x2019;s been going on? Where am I?&#x201d;</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows and dipped the brush into the cup. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know? Open your mouth.&#x201d;</p> <p>I raised a hand to hold him off. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. I can do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>He handed it over cheerfully. &#x201c;I doubt it.&#x201d;</p> <p>I took the brush and tried to use it, my fingers trembling with the effort. After only a couple of strokes, my entire arm felt heavy, and I missed my teeth completely, delivering a swatch of foam across my chin.</p> <p>Leo shook his head, satisfied by his foresight. &#x201c;Give me that. You&#x2019;re making a mess.&#x201d; He took it away and set to work, neatly and gently. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in Lebanon, New Hampshire-the Hitchcock Hospital-and you&#x2019;ve been under for three weeks, Joey-gram negative septicemia-that&#x2019;s what they said you had. Fancy for blood poisoning. What the knife started, your own guts spilling into the rest of you almost finished. You had the docs scrambling a couple of times. Bad fevers, seizures, times you were delirious-you gave &#x2018;em a run for their money. They tell me you lost forty pounds just lying here. By the way, who&#x2019;s paying for all this?&#x201d;</p> <p>I gurgled something, and he shrugged, &#x201c;Oh, right. Sorry. Here &#x2014;&#x201d; he brandished the all-purpose cup. &#x201c;Spit.&#x201d;</p> <p>I spat.</p> <p>&#x201c;The reason I ask, you got first class all the way-police escort for the ambulance from the dam; helicopter ride up from Brattleboro; the best surgical team they had to offer here... You know how long they worked on you?&#x201d;</p> <p>I knew better than to try to answer. When Leo was on a roll, there was no point trying to stop him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Eight hours. Gail and I were sitting outside the whole time. They tried getting us to go home, but forget that. Anyway, it was the same bunch working on you the whole night. I thought docs were a little overpaid, you know? But when I saw the head guy-when he came out to tell us you&#x2019;d pulled through the operation-he looked like he&#x2019;d earned his keep. That son-of-a-gun looked beat. You know what I mean?&#x201d;</p> <p>He punched me gently on the shoulder and then immediately leaned over me, his eyes inches from mine. &#x201c;Damn, you okay? Got a little carried away. That didn&#x2019;t hurt, did it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Leo.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was already massaging the shoulder with his big paw, doing far more damage than he had with the punch. He suddenly stopped again and took my face in his hands, as he might a small child&#x2019;s. His face was serious and troubled, in abrupt contrast to the beaming expression he&#x2019;d been showering on me so far. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing okay now, aren&#x2019;t you? Feeling better?&#x201d;</p> <p>I tried to nod between his hands, and muttered through puckered lips, &#x201c;Fine-a little tired.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve been banged up before-even out like a light for a couple of days-but this time... I don&#x2019;t know... You really had me scared. You actually died a couple of times, you know that?&#x201d;</p> <p>I tried shaking my head politely, with less success.</p> <p>He glanced up at the machines clustered around me. &#x201c;Hadn&#x2019;t been for all this stuff-and all the people here-you would&#x2019;ve been history.&#x201d; He paused, his eyes gleaming brightly. &#x201c;You scared the shit out of me.&#x201d;</p> <p>He gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it again,&#x201d; and disappeared as magically as he&#x2019;d appeared.</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>Can-Am</h2><p>Unrestricted cars, outrageous designs, monster engines, and very high speeds were all hallmarks of the Can-Am sports car series races.

Someday, he would travel the world and have adventures, just like Don Winslow. But then the radio, which had been growing fainter, went dead altogether -- and Johnny's parents couldn't afford to buy a new one. Johnny refused to give up hope. Maybe Mr. Zaga, who lived in the basement apartment and was supposed to be an inventor, could help. <p> Mr. Zaga's apartment was full of weird machinery. He was interested in time travel, not in repairing radios, and he believed that with powerful electrostatic magnetism he could project himself into the future. But perhaps an electric charge from his machinery could fix the radio. Sure enough, the radio played again, but before long Johnny and Mr. Zaga discovered that the radio was giving <i>tomorrow's</i> news. It was a day ahead in time! </p><p> The adventures Johnny has then -- at a nearby bank robbery, a local fire, and with Mr. Zaga at the racetrack -- fill this funny and exciting book and will delight young readers. Full-color pictures rendered by a distinguished author/illustrator capture the big-city scene and a small boy's dreams of glory to perfection.</p></p><p>Vigorous illustrations of 1920s scenes animate this uneven melodrama, a blend of nostalgia and science fiction. Johnny, a youth wearing knickers and argyle socks, follows broadcast adventure serials. When his beloved radio gives up the ghost, Johnny takes it to an inventor for repairs. The man doesn't know much about appliances: "My specialty is time travel," he says. But he applies "a small charge of electrostatic magnetism," and the radio revives. Better yet, it now announces the news a day in advance (a la TV's Early Edition). Johnny earns his "on the spot" nickname by showing up at the scene of a bank holdup and a fire (and helping out), but the lure of easy money threatens on a day at the races ("It's not gambling... We know which horse will win," the inventor begs). Sorel, known for his New Yorker cover art, constructs an enticing cinematic world of brownstones and sepia-tinted interiors. His gestural scribbles of ink, applied in darting and sweeping zigzags, give the impression of rapid progress, while his earth-tone watercolor palette suggests budding technology. Yet the plot fails to ignite, then wraps up too neatly. The time-travel genre cliches (the boy, the eccentric inventor, the discovery, the abuse of power) recall the convoluted plots of radio shows, but Johnny's moral dilemma is solved too readily when his parents junk the "broken" Zenith and buy a Philco. Ages 5-9. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.In a wonderful, transporting story, set in New York City during the early 1900s, Johnny has just listened to the last gasps of his old radio. His family, living in a building under a bridge, can't afford a new one. So Johnny asks a neighbor, Mr. Zaga, a man known to be an inventor, if he can coax life from the old box. Mr. Zaga confesses little knowledge of radios, but suggests they blast it with an under-powered time machine he is working on, and the radio starts to spout tomorrow's news. Mr. Zaga warns Johnny not to tamper with the future, and Johnny must do some fancy dancing to thwart a bank robbery and to save a girl from a burning building, earning the moniker ``Johnny-on-the-spot'' from the local news establishment. Then he and Mr. Zaga make a boodle during a day at the horse races. When they return home, they find a new radio, a reward for Johnny's daring exploits, and the old radio has gone out with the trash. Adults may quibble over the way Johnny and Mr. Zaga redistribute the betting world's wealth, but it feels natural and right in this context. Sorel's artwork acts almost as a time machine itself; it has the character and energy to lift readers from their seats and set them down in the Big Apple some 70 years ago.

She grew up in a large family in Maryland and began visiting Lancaster County&#x2019;s Amish community as a child. Lauer attended Wagner College in New York City and worked as an editor for Simon &amp; Schuster and Harlequin Books. She now lives with her family in Oregon, where she writes in the shade of some towering two-hundred-year-old Douglas fir trees.APRIL<br> &nbsp;<br> The gentle spring breeze sent cherry blossoms floating through the air, pink petals settling over Rachel and James as they walked hand in hand through the orchard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rachel King stepped away from him and held her arms out, wanting to breathe in the beauty of the petal shower. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like falling snow!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James Lapp planted his legs apart and tipped back his hat. A slight smile appeared as he watched her reach out to catch falling petals. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the difference between us, Rachel. You see a shower of flower petals. I see early blooms that&#x2019;ll wither if we get a late frost.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So practical.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the good in living off the land. It keeps a man down-to-earth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re used to this wonderful sight, working in the orchard every day, but there&#x2019;s something about blossoming trees that makes the heart burst with joy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ya, if you don&#x2019;t have to prune them.&#x201d; The warmth in his dark eyes told her he was teasing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is it a chore when you love what you do? You&#x2019;ve told me yourself that your dat used to call you a tree monkey. When it was time to pick peaches, he couldn&#x2019;t get you to stay on the ladder.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James chuckled. &#x201c;That was me.&#x201d; He leaped up, grabbed on to an overhead branch, and hung there a moment before doing an easy chin-up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still a tree monkey!&#x201d; she said, glorying in the cascade of petals loosened by the jolt to the tree limb.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ya, but I&#x2019;ve learned that a ladder is the easiest way up a tree.&#x201d; With dark hair that framed his handsome face and smoky eyes that warmed for Rachel, James was solid and grounded. His steady calm was one of the things that had won Rachel over a year ago when he&#x2019;d started driving her home from singings and youth gatherings. At a time when other Amish fellas were putting boom boxes in their buggies and tossing back beers, James followed a simple path, choosing baptism and the management of the Lapp family orchards. Rachel liked to picture him as the root system that anchored her to the earth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James dropped to the ground and leaned down to pick up a fallen bud. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s one for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rachel held her breath as he came close, brushing back the edge of her prayer Kapp to tuck the pale pink bud over her left ear. His touch sent shimmers rippling down her spine even as the gesture warmed her from head to toe. Ya, he kept her feet on the ground, but he let her heart soar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There.&#x201d; His dark eyes held her as his broad hands dropped to her shoulders. &#x201c;You are the finest blossom in the Lapp orchard.&#x201d; His arms encircled her, and she melted in his embrace. Rachel loved the way he made her feel small and delicate against his strong, solid body. His lips touched hers gently, quick as a butterfly&#x2019;s glance, but she felt the spark of love in that kiss.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We should go to the sugar shack,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Out here in the orchard&nbsp;...&nbsp;people can see. Your parents might be watching.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;With these trees so thick with blossoms? I think we&#x2019;re well hidden.&#x201d; He caught her in his dark gaze. The flicker in his eyes let her know that he was feeling the same love that stirred her heart. Could he feel the quiet tremble of her limbs? Or the wooziness that overtook her when his lips nuzzled her jaw, leaving a trail of tingling sensation that became heated by his warm breath?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; he whispered, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if they see us. I don&#x2019;t care if they know that I love you, Rachel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>I love you, Rachel.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> His words swelled and blossomed inside her, filling her heart with goodness and light. But just when they were about to kiss, the sweet moment faded, slipping away like sugar sifting between her fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dream&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was all a dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the pink light of early morning, Rachel opened her eyes to blots of color that made up the large bedroom shared by the King girls.<br> &nbsp;<br> All a dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rachel closed her eyes and clung to the sweetness, holding tight to the scent of cherry blossoms and the sureness of love. James loved her! And James was strong, standing and walking and swinging from a tree, healthy and hearty as ever!<br> &nbsp;<br> She tried to hold in the goodness of the dream, but reality tapped on her mind like fat raindrops. James would not be grabbing on to a tree in the orchard today, or anytime soon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before she could ease herself away, she was back in that terrible moment, hearing the sickening screech of tires on the road, the grind of metal. The accident. Although Rachel had been able to walk away from the wrecked van, James had not. He was still recovering from spinal injuries, confined to a wheelchair for now. Maybe forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sighing, she rolled over to see her younger sisters asleep in the double bed. Twelve-year-old Bethany&#x2019;s bare foot hung out from under the quilt, and nine-year-old Molly&#x2019;s sweet lips were pursed like a rosebud. Sleep was the only time Molly&#x2019;s lips were still, but Rachel didn&#x2019;t mind her chatterbox little sister. In fact, her sister&#x2019;s gabbing was just the sort of reassuring company Rachel had sought when she gave up her room in the attic to move down here with the younger girls. Rachel had hoped to spend more time with sister Rose, too, but Rose, now sixteen, had other notions. Eager to leap into Rumspringa, Rose had missed the point of companionship and moved up to Rachel&#x2019;s room, sure that a young man would soon come courting at her window. Oh, Rose, so full of dreams!<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, Rachel was grateful for the chance to talk more with her other sisters, whose steady breathing in the bed across from her was reassuring. Let Rose have the room upstairs; no young man would be calling for Rachel anytime soon, not with James still unable to walk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rachel closed her eyes in the hopes of recapturing the sweet dream&#x2014;reliving the time when James had moved freely and managed the family orchard without fail. With a deep breath, she tried to bring back the scent of blossoms and the warm strength of James&#x2019;s arms around her.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the dream was gone, and so was the James she had fallen in love with. The accident had pulled him away from her&nbsp;...&nbsp;so far away. Many things changed when a vehicle had hit the van Rachel and James had been riding in back in January. The other driver, a young Englisher girl, had been killed, and James&#x2019;s uncle Tom Lapp had died later in the hospital. So much heartbreak for two families, Englisher and Amish alike. The accident had sent old Jacob Fisher into a terrible fit of breathing, but he seemed to be recovering, thank the good Lord. And James, her James had hurt his back, really bad.<br> &nbsp;<br> The golden wash of light told Rachel that it would be time to start the day soon, a fine Monday morning. Time to wake her sisters and roust them from bed. There were chores to be done, a breakfast to prepare. Cows to milk, and a house and barns to redd up. All tasks that went against Rachel&#x2019;s grain. But now, she would do the stinkiest chores gladly if it meant that James could get better.<br> &nbsp;<br> She slid out of bed, pulled the quilt over her shoulders, and padded barefoot to the window seat Dat had built. Outside, sunshine shot over the green and purple hills in the distance. The morning air was cold, but the sun promised warmth to the day&#x2014;Gott&#x2019;s promise of springtime and light and hope. Rachel thought of the colors in the paint kit her Englisher friend Haley had given her and wished she had time to paint right now. How she would enjoy mixing colors to come up with spring-field green, daffodil yellow, crocus purple, and the rich blots of pink and purple and orange and red that made up a sunrise. Upstairs in her old room, among the many unfinished canvases, was a new painting she had just finished for James. It was different from her usual style, but she thought it might spark some joy in his heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> And James was so very much in need of joy.</p><h2>The Buddha and His Dhamma</h2><p>ABOUT THE BOOK:- This book is the first reprint edition of great reformist, farsighted and the father of Indian Constitution Dr. B R Ambedkar.

In comparison to her painting and sculpture, Graves's prints have received little attention. This beautiful book illustrates Graves's entire graphic oeuvre and illuminates the artist's exacting concern for matters of form, material, and process.<br>In his essay, Thomas Padon offers an overview of Graves's printmaking activity and discusses the development of her complex visual language. In the interview with the author, Graves offers the first discussion of her specific interest in printmaking, her methodology, and the role of the medium in her overall oeuvre. The second half of the book constitutes a catalogue raisonne of Graves's graphic work, which comprises nearly 200 prints made at many of the leading printmaking workshops, including Tyler Graphics, Graphicstudio, and 2RC Edizioni d'Arte. Most of these works are published for the first time in this comprehensive volume.<br>Graves is unusually attuned to the phenomena of nature. A passionate interest in science led her to introduce unorthodox forms drawn from astronomy, botany, cartography, and zoology into her art. In the last decade, her intellectual pursuits have taken a more humanist course as she has recast world history into an enigmatic pictorial idiom. Graves has spoken of her desire to make art out of what she terms the "shards of art," and she has assembled a cache of images drawn from various disciplines, eras, and civilizations.</p><p>Thomas Padon is Director of Exhibitions at the American Federation of Arts, New York.American artist Nancy Graves (1940-1995) made astonishing prints that, like her painting and sculpture, freely cross boundaries of mediums, disciplines and eras. This catalogue of an exhibition that will tour nationally is filled with images of arresting beauty. Graves's poetic lithographs based on geologic maps of Lunar Orbiter and Apollo landing sites signal her preoccupation with how information is visualized and transmitted. She creates primal metaphors based on Paleolithic cave paintings and, in Quipu, a filigree depiction of an ancient Andean knotted-string counting device, reclaims the spirit of the past. Other prints exuberantly combine biomorphic forms, art-historical allusions, geometric patterns and historical figures in ways that celebrate the continuum of history and the links between cultures. In his illuminating essay, Padon, a director at the American Federation of Arts, New York, sensitively explores a body of work open to multiple readings. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Eiger Dreams</h2><p>A compelling study of mountain climbing captures the determination, thirst for adventure and challenge, and obsession of the individuals who climb such mountains as Denali, K2, Everest, the Eiger, and other notable peaks throughout the world</p><p>No matter what the actual temperature may be, several pages into <i>Eiger Dreams</i> you will begin to shiver. Halfway through you will acquire a new appreciation for your fingers, toes, and the fact that you still have a nose. And by the end of this collection, you'll define some commonly used phrases in an entirely different way. The understated "catch some air" and the whimsical "log some flight time" are climbers' euphemisms for falling, while "crater" refers to what happens when you log some flight time all the way to the ground. "Summiting," the term for reaching the top of a mountain, seems almost colorless in comparison. The various heroes, risk-takers, incompetents, and individualists Krakauer captures are more than colorful, whether they summit or not. The author is more interested in exploring the addiction of risk--the intensity of effort--than mere triumph. There's the mythical minimalist climber, John Gill, whose fame "rests entirely on assents less than thirty feet high," and the Burgess brothers--freewheeling, free-floating English twins who seem to make all the right decisions when it counts, and hence most often fail to reach the top. Of course, they are <i>alive</i>. Over these and other talented climbers hangs a malignant, endlessly creative nature--its <i>foehn</i> winds can make people crazy and its avalanches do far worse. <i>Eiger Dreams</i> is an adrenaline fest for the weary, an overdue examination of a stylish, brave subculture. As one of the heroes Krakauer outlines says of his occupation, "It's sort of like having fun, only different."No one writes about mountaineering and its attendant victories and hardships more brilliantly than Jon Krakauer. In this collection of his finest essays and reporting, Krakauer writes of mountains from the memorable perspective of one who has himself struggled with solo madness to scale Alaska's notorious Devils Thumb. <p></p><p>In Pakistan, the fearsome K2 kills thirteen of the world's most experienced mountain climbers in one horrific summer. In Valdez, Alaska, two men scale a frozen waterfall over a four-hundred-foot drop. In France, a hip international crowd of rock climbers, bungee jumpers, and paragliders figure out new ways to risk their lives on the towering peaks of Mont Blanc. Why do they do it? How do they do it? In this extraordinary book, Krakauer presents an unusual fraternity of daredevils, athletes, and misfits stretching the limits of the possible.</p><p></p><p>From the paranoid confines of a snowbound tent, to the thunderous, suffocating terror of a white-out on Mount McKinley, <i>Eiger Dreams</i> spins tales of driven lives, sudden deaths, and incredible victories. This is a stirring, vivid book about one of the most compelling and dangerous of all human pursuits.</p></p><h2>My America: Flying Free: Corey&#39;s Underground Railroad Diary, Book Two</h2><p>In this sequel to My America: Freedom's Wings, Corey Birdsong and his family have escaped slavery and the South and found refuge in Canada.

But danger still remains across the river in Ohio, where slavecatchers lurk, waiting to capture escaped slaves to bring them back to their former masters. Corey, however, outsmarts them, and brings his friend Mingo to safety in Canada.</p><p>Sharon Dennis Wyeth has written nearly fifty books for children, including several books in the My America series. She is also a poet, and a member of the Cave Canem Fellowship for African-American Poets. She lives in Upper Montclair, New Jersey.Corey Birdsong and his family have reached freedom in Canada in this sequel to Freedom's Wings (not reviewed). His journal relates the last harrowing days of their flight from slavery, their feelings of rapture upon arrival, and the steps they take to forge a new, independent life. They are welcomed in a community that is made up largely of other former slaves. Here they dare to dream of owning their own farm, of proper schooling, of making their mark. Corey is fascinated by the people around him, and makes special note of the black people who have responsible, respected places in society. But they must always be aware that there are slave-catchers just over the water who are waiting for a chance to recapture the runaways and return them to slavery. And always in their hearts are the people they left behind, like Corey's best friend Mingo. Wyeth breathes full life into Corey. His voice is true and clear. He is loving, curious, intelligent, brave, and determined. He's thrilled by all the new sights, sounds, and experiences, and describes everything and everyone with delightful and insightful enthusiasm. There are many well-written works for children concerning daring and dangerous escapes along the Underground Railroad, but most end with the first steps into Canada. Here, finally, is a glimpse of what came next. Besides weaving many historically accurate facts within the story, Wyeth provides an interesting, informative afterword that includes period photographs. Fascinating.--Kirkus Reviews<br>In Patriots, Hope, 10, lives in Philadelphia in 1777. George Washington and his troops are nearby fighting the Redcoats, who capture the city and move into her home. Gregory engages readers with the tumultuous elements of conflict and war, making this book a page-turner. Flying follows Corey, 10, an escaped slave who is now forging a life as a free person in Canada with his family. With the exception of the rescue of his best friend, there is little excitement in this plotless, formulaic story. Also, Corey's facility with language doesn't ring true. The historical note at the end of each volume offers interesting facts and a few black-and-white photos. The large font size and short entries make these books quick and accessible to reluctant and good readers alike. Although not great literature, they may be popular historical-fiction choices for kids who are willing to suspend disbelief.--School Library Journal<br><br></p><h2>The Wolves of Alaska: A Fact-based Saga</h2><p>Alaska&#39;s wolves are the main characters in this historically and biologically accurate recounting.

They call me The Graveyard Queen. I've been commissioned to restore an old cemetery in Asher Falls, South Carolina, but I'm coming to think I have another purpose here.<br><br>Why is there a cemetery at the bottom of Bell Lake? Why am I drawn time and again to a hidden grave I've discovered in the woods? Something is eating away at the soul of this town&#x2014;this withering kingdom&#x2014;and it will only be restored if I can uncover the truth.<br><br></p><p>Amanda Stevens is an award-winning author of over fifty novels.&nbsp;Born and raised in the rural south, she now resides in Houston, Texas.The breeze off the water carried a slight chill even though the sun had barely begun its western slide. It was still hours until twilight. Hours until the veil between our world and the next would thin, but already I could feel the ripple of goose bumps at the back of my neck, a sensation that almost always signaled an unnatural presence.<br><br>I resisted the temptation to glance over my shoulder. Years of living with ghosts had instilled in me an aberrant discipline. I knew better than to react to those greedy, grasping entities, so I leaned against the deck rail and stared intently into the greenish depths of the lake. But from my periphery, I tracked the other passengers on the ferry.<br><br>The intimate murmurs and soft laughter from the couple next to me aroused an unexpected melancholy, and I thought suddenly of John Devlin, the police detective I'd left behind in Charleston. This time of day, he would probably still be at work, and I conjured up an image of him hunched over a cluttered desk, reviewing autopsy reports and crime scene photos. Did I cross his mind now and then? Not that it mattered. He was a man haunted by his dead wife and daughter, and I was a woman who saw ghosts. For as long as he clung to his past&#x2014;and his past clung to him&#x2014;I could not be a part of his life.<br><br>So I wouldn't dwell on Devlin or that terrible door that my feelings for him had opened. In the months since I'd last seen him, my life had settled back into a normal routine. Normal for me, at least. I still saw ghosts, but those darker entities&#x2014;the Others, my father called them&#x2014;had drifted back into their murky underworld where I prayed they would remain. The memories, however, lingered. Memories of Devlin, memories of all those victims and of a haunted killer who had made me a target. I knew no matter how hard I fought them off, the nightmares would return the moment I closed my eyes.<br><br>For now, though, I wanted to savor my adventure. The start of a new commission filled me with excitement, and I looked forward to the prospect of uncovering the history of yet another graveyard, of immersing myself in the lives of those who had been laid to rest there. I always say that cemetery restoration is more than just clearing away trash and overgrowth. It's about <i>restoration.</i><br><br>The back of my neck continued to prickle.<br><br>After a moment, I turned to casually glance back at the row of cars. My silver SUV was one of only five vehicles on the ferry. Another SUV belonged to the couple, a green minivan to a middle-aged woman absorbed in a battered paperback novel, and a faded red pickup truck to an elderly man sipping coffee from a foam cup. That left the vintage black sports car. The metallic jet paint drew my appreciative gaze. In the sunlight, the shimmer reminded me of snake scales, and an inexplicable shiver traced along my spine as I admired the serpentine lines. The windows were tinted, blocking my view of the interior, but I imagined the driver behind the wheel, impatiently drumming fingers as the ferry inched toward the other side. To Asher Falls. To Thorngate Cemetery, my ultimate destination.<br><br>Brushing my hand against the back of my neck, I turned again to the water, mentally rummaging through the tidbits I'd gleaned from my research. Located in the lush Blue Ridge foothills of South Carolina, Asher Falls had once been a thriving community, but in the mid-eighties, one of the town's most prominent citizens, Pell Asher, had struck an unsavory bargain. He'd sold acreage to the state to be used as a reservoir, and when the dam opened, the area flooded, including the main highway leading into Asher Falls. Already bypassed by a new freeway system, the town sank into oblivion. The only way in and out was by ferry or back roads, and the population soon withered. Asher Falls became just another statistic in a long line of dying rural communities.<br><br>I'd never set foot in the town, even to conduct a preliminary assessment of the cemetery. I'd been hired sight unseen by a real estate agent named Luna Kemper, who also happened to be the town librarian and the sole administrator of a generous donation made anonymously to the Daughters of our Valiant Heroes, a historical society/garden club for the beautification of Thorngate Cemetery. Luna's offer couldn't have come at a more perfect time. I needed a new project and a change of scenery, so here I stood.<br><br>As we approached the dock, the engines powered down and we came to a near standstill. The heavy shadows cast by towering trees at the shoreline deepened the water to black. At no point could I see the bottom, but for a moment, I could have sworn I saw something&#x2014;<i>someone</i>&#x2014;just below the surface. A pale face staring up at me....<br><br>My heart took a nosedive as I leaned over the railing, searching those blackish depths. People without my ability would have undoubtedly wondered if the play of light and shadow on the water had tricked them. Or worse, if they might have spotted a body being washed ashore in the ferry's wake. I thought instantly of a ghost and wondered who on board might be haunted by the golden-haired apparition floating underneath the water.<br><br>"I believe this is yours."<br><br>A man's voice pulled me back from the railing, and I turned reluctantly from the lake. I knew at once he belonged to the sports car. He and the vehicle had the same dark, sleek air. I thought him to be around my age&#x2014;twenty-seven&#x2014;with eyes the exact shade of a tidal marsh. He was tallish, though not so tall as Devlin, nor as thin. Years of being haunted had left the magnetic police detective hollow-eyed and gaunt while the stranger at my side appeared to be the picture of health&#x2014;lean, sinewy and suntanned.<br><br>"I beg your pardon?"<br><br>He extended his hand, and I thought at first he meant to introduce himself, but instead he uncurled his fingers, and I saw my necklace coiled in his palm.<br><br>My hand went immediately to my throat. "Oh! The chain must have snapped." I plucked the necklace from his hand and examined the links. They were unbroken, the clasp still securely closed. "How strange," I murmured, unlatching the claw fastener and entwining the silver strand around my neck. "Where did you find it?"<br><br>"It was lying on the deck behind you." His gaze slid downward as the polished stone settled into the hollow of my throat.<br><br>Something cold gripped my heart. A warning?<br><br>"Thank you," I said stiffly. "I would have hated to lose it."<br><br>"It's an interesting piece." He appeared to study the amulet intently. "A good luck charm?"<br><br>"You might say that." Actually, the stone had come from the hallowed ground of a cemetery where my father had worked as caretaker when I was a child. Whether the talisman retained any of Rosehill's protective properties, I had no idea. I only knew that I felt stronger against the ghosts when I wore it.<br><br>I started to turn back to the water, but something in the stranger's eyes, a mysterious glint, held me for a moment longer.<br><br>"Are you okay?" he asked unexpectedly.<br><br>"Yes, I'm fine. Why do you ask?"<br><br>He nodded toward the side of the ferry. "You were leaning so far over the railing when I came up, and then I saw your necklace on the deck. I was afraid you might be contemplating jumping."<br><br>"Oh, that." I gave a negligible shrug. "I thought I saw something in the water. Probably just a shadow."<br><br>The glint in his eyes deepened. "I wouldn't be too sure. You'd be surprised at what lies beneath the surface of this lake. Some of it occasionally floats to the top."<br><br>"Such as?"<br><br>"Debris, mostly. Glass bottles, bits of old clothing. I even once saw a rocking chair drifting to shore."<br><br>"Where does it all come from?"<br><br>"Flooded houses." As he turned to stare out over the water, I studied his profile, drawn by the way the late afternoon sunlight burnished his dark hair. The coppery threads gave him an aura of warmth that seemed to be absent from the midnight-green of his eyes. "Before the dam was built, the lake was half the size it is now. A lot of property was destroyed when the water rose."<br><br>"But that was years ago. You mean the houses are still down there?" I tried to peer through the layers of algae and hydrilla, but I could see nothing. Not even the ghostly face I'd spotted earlier.<br><br>"Houses, cars...an old graveyard."<br><br>My gaze shot back to him. "A graveyard?"<br><br>"Thorngate Cemetery. Another casualty of the Asher greed."<br><br>"But I thought." Uneasiness crept over me. I was good at my job, but recovering an underwater cemetery wasn't exactly my area of expertise. "I've seen recent pictures of Thorngate. It looked high and dry to me."<br><br>"There are two Thorngates," he said. "And I assure you that one of them does rest at the bottom of this lake."<br><br>"How did that happen?"<br><br>"The original Thorngate was rarely used. It was all but forgotten. No one ever went out there. No one gave it a second thought...until the water came."<br><br>I stared at him in horror. "Are you telling me the bodies weren't moved before they expanded the lake?"<br><br>He shuddered. "Afterward, people started seeing things. Hearing things."<br><br>I fingered the talisman at my throat. "Like what?"<br><br>He hesitated, his gaze still on the water. "If you look for this basin on any South Carolina map, you'll find the Asher Reservoir. But around here, we call it Bell Lake."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"In the old days, coffins were equipped with a warning system&#x2014;a chain attached to a bell on the grave in case of a premature burial. They say at night, when the mist rolls in, you can hear those bells." He glanced over the railing. "The dead down there don't want to be forgotten...<i>ever again."</i></p><h2>Tasty Latest &amp; Greatest</h2><p>Tasty is the world&#39;s largest social food network, reaching more than 500 million people around the globe with its signature fun, easy and delicious video recipes.

Eighteen hours later, Matthew was found tied to a log fence on the outskirts of town, unconscious and barely alive. He had been pistol-whipped so severely that the mountain biker who discovered his battered frame mistook him for a Halloween scarecrow. Overnight, a politically expedient myth took the place of important facts. By the time Matthew died a few days later, his name was synonymous with anti-gay hate. <br><br>Stephen Jimenez<b> </b>went to Laramie to research the story of Matthew Shepard&#x2019;s murder in 2000, after the two men convicted of killing him had gone to prison, and after the national media had moved on. His aim was to write a screenplay on what he, and the rest of the nation, believed to be an open-and-shut case of bigoted violence. As a gay man, he felt an added moral imperative to tell Matthew&#x2019;s story. But what Jimenez eventually found in Wyoming was a tangled web of secrets. His exhaustive investigation also plunged him deep into the deadly underworld of&nbsp;drug&nbsp;trafficking. Over the course of a thirteen-year investigation, Jimenez traveled to twenty states and Washington DC, and interviewed more than a hundred named sources. <br><br><i>The Book of Matt </i>is sure to stir passions and inspire dialogue as it re-frames this misconstrued crime and its cast of characters, proving irrefutably that Matthew Shepard was not killed for being gay but for reasons far more complicated &#x2014; and daunting.</p></p><p><p><b>Guest Review of <i>The Book of Matt: Hidden Truths About the Murder of Matthew Shepard</i></b></p><p></p><b> <p>By Kenneth S. Stern</p></b><p></p> <p>Stephen Jimenez&#x2019;s <i>The Book of Matt: Hidden Truths About the Murder of Matthew Shepard</i> is a compelling story of a journalist&#x2019;s determination to ascertain why Matthew Shepard -- a gay University of Wyoming student -- was viciously killed in 1998. The story that had been told in the media, and to some extent in the courtroom, was that Shepard had made a pass at two strangers in a bar, who became outraged, took Shepard to a remote spot, bashed his head in, and left him affixed to a fence, to die. It was the anti-gay hate crime of the century, and while the rationale for including anti-gay attacks under hate crime law was clearly established long before the Shepard murder, his case became a symbol and rallying point for such legislation.</p> <p>Jimenez, however, uncovered another story, one that was to some extent unappreciated at the time of the crime, but was also intentionally hidden for a variety of motivations. Among those motivations were fear, courtroom strategy, and the desire of media, activists, and others to believe the powerful story of a gay man being brutally killed for no other reason than he made an unwelcome pass at a man he happened to meet in a bar.</p> <p>Shepard and his killer, Aaron McKinney, were not strangers after all. In fact Aaron McKinney was a bisexual, who had had sex with Shepard. And both were dealers of methamphetamine.</p> <p>Jimenez makes a strong case that the unappreciated lesson of the Shepard murder is one about the dangers of methamphetamine. This book is a well-constructed narrative of a 13-year investigative quest by a talented author whose passion for uncovering the true story rings clear. Highly recommended</p> <p><strong>Kenneth S.

So young, bathed in a buttermilk glow, the silver of the night muted, warm and gentle.<br><br>He placed a powerful gloved hand over the young man's mouth, then slit his throat, his sharply honed knife moving as smoothly through flesh as the fastest Donzi speeding through a calm sea. It wasn't half as easy as it appeared in movies to slash a throat. Even with a knife as sharp as his, it took effort. And talent.<br><br>He had the strength, and he had the talent.<br><br>The boy made a slight gurgling sound, but that was it.

Not to mention that <em>he </em>was the one with a mission.<br><br>He paused again, going dead still. Silence. The house was filled with silence. It was time to make his point before finishing the mission. He dipped his gloved finger in the dead girl's blood, then walked over to the wall, writing quickly so he could finish while the blood was still wet and glistening.

She didn't know if she had wakened just a few seconds ago, or if a dozen minutes had ticked away. She'd heard something, some sound, as she slept in the beachfront mansion, and though it was enough to wake her up, it hadn't scared her in the least. After all, the housekeeper was sleeping somewhere on the property, as were the two live-in maids, and there were at least twenty young people scattered around the house, ranging in age from sixteen to twenty-one.<br><br>David Grant, a big, burly football star, had passed out on the sofa downstairs, she knew. And Kit Ames, his girlfriend, had claimed the floor nearby. Even if it meant sleeping on the floor, Kit wouldn't go far from David. She protected her turf with more ferocity than most of the players demonstrated on the field.<br><br>But then something, something too elusive to identify, had alerted her, as if her every sense had been attuned to the night. She'd sensed movement somewhere in the house.<br><br>Not the natural movement of those who belonged, those who had been invited in. It was subtle, as if she had heard the slithering of a snake moving through distant grass.<br><br>She was sharing a room with two of the other girls, and at first both of them had appeared to be sleeping peacefully. But then she'd realized something was wrong, though she couldn't explain how she'd known it. She'd tried to wake Jen Petersen, but Jen had been so deeply asleep that she hadn't responded to her urgent whispers. She'd had more success with Victoria Preston, who'd just begun to rouse, when she had seen the man enter the room. He'd been all in black, wearing what looked like a black dive suit, including a tight hood that covered everything but his eyes and mouth. He hadn't seen her or Victoria but had gone straight to Jen and stared down at her for a moment. Then, before Chloe could move, he struck.<br><br>She tried not to scream and clamped a hand over Victoria's mouth. Jen's bed was close to the door, so to get away they had to make it to the bathroom connecting their room to the bedroom next door. Amazed by how quickly her mind was working in the midst of panic, she grabbed Victoria's arm and dragged her into the bathroom, slamming the door behind them.<br><br>Victoria started screaming then, and Chloe shoved her out into the hall. As Chloe started to follow, someone closed the door from the outside, leaving her no choice but to retreat to the other bedroom.<br><br>There was more than one stranger in the house, she realized.<br><br>More than one killer.<br><br>The bedroom door started to open as someone began dragging a body in.

Spilling across the floor.<br><br>Dripping from above her. From a body on the bed.<br><br>She tried not to scream and waited, listening. They were barely discernible, but she could hear footsteps. She stared into the room from her hiding place and saw that the killer wore clear plastic freezer bags over his feet. And his dive skin, appropriate for the balmy waters of Florida and the Caribbean, was sold by the thousands in the area.<br><br>Two killers, one in this room and one next door. Or were there more? Had Victoria made it down the stairs?<br><br>She watched his feet moving stealthily across the floor and into the bathroom.<br><br>He would find her there beneath the bed. He was bound to.<br><br>Knowing she had no choice, she rolled out from beneath the bed, and carefully, silently, on bare feet, hurried to the door to the hallway. She looked out and saw no one, so she slipped out, hoping to find someone else alive, hoping to find something with which to save herself.<br><br>Nothing. No one. She raced along the hall to the stairway. Ochre light filled the living room at the foot of the grand stairway.<br><br>Red spilled out across the marble there, too.<br><br>Red spelled a message on the wall.<br><br><em>Death to defilers!</em><br><br>There was a picture in red, as well....<br><br>A strangely shaped hand drawn in blood.<br><br>She sensed movement behind her and turned to look. Brad Angsley, Victoria's college-age cousin, was staggering out from one of the other bedrooms, holding his head. She rushed toward him.<br><br>"He's right behind us!" he cried<br><br>"Move!" she insisted, and helped him stagger down the stairs. As they reached the great entry with its double doors, she dared a quick look back.<br><br>Someone was coming after them, another man in black, with some kind of knapsack or canvas bag over his shoulder.<br><br>Which killer was he?<br><br>Were there more ahead? What would happen when she opened the door? Would another killer be waiting there?<br><br>She had no choice but to find out. She struggled briefly with the lock, then threw open the doors and raced out, with Brad clinging to her shoulder. They made it down the long gravel path to the driveway and had almost lost themselves amidst the collection of BMWs, Audis and beat-up cars that belonged to the average kids who had made their way here.<br><br>Behind them, closing in on them, she could hear pounding footsteps.<br><br>They turned together, and she could see the knife gleaming in the moonlight, the blade dripping blood.<br><br>She leaned Brad against a car and grabbed a statue of Poseidon. It was heavy, but she barely noticed its weight as she wrenched it from the ground and swung it with both arms.<br><br>She caught their pursuer on the side of the head. He staggered back, and she let out a scream that seemed to last forever, until she realized that Brad had broken into the car, setting off its alarm.<br><br>Lights suddenly blazed, illuminating the driveway. Chloe saw Victoria stagger from the trees bordering the drive, holding tight to Jared Walker, who appeared to be unharmed, though his face was ashen.<br><br>Victoria was waving a cell phone as she yelled, "Hang on! Help is coming!"<br><br>Thank God for technology, Chloe thought.<br><br>The lights were coming from the cop cars that were swarming onto the property.<br><br>Chloe stared at her attacker, praying that he would fall, that he wouldn't come after them again before the cops could take aim and fire.<br><br>The man stared back at her, his mask torn where the statue had caught it, and she felt as if she was staring into the face of pure evil.<br><br>Her heart stopped, and she prayed.<br><br>But he didn't come closer; instead, he took one look at the approaching cops, then turned and ran.<br><br>As if on cue, the moon slipped behind a cloud, and the killer was lost in the deep shadows beside the house.<br><br>Cops and paramedics began rushing onto the property.<br><br>Someone took Brad; someone else grabbed Chloe, and she opened her mouth to scream.<br><br>"It's all right," a man's voice assured her, and she found herself staring at a policeman. "You're hurt. You need help."<br><br>"I'm not hurt," she said, then lifted her hands and realized that they were bathed in blood.<br><br>Crimson with blood.<br><br>Red-shot darkness descended on her, and she slipped into oblivion.<br><br>It was over, and yet not over.<br><br>In the days and months that followed, she saw them all again. Her friends, with their good traits and their bad, who never had a chance to mature and become good people or selfish assholes.<br><br>They haunted her dreams.<br><br>She saw them dead, where they had lain on the floor in spreading pools of red.<br><br>Yes, she saw them in her dreams. Or were they dreams? She would simply open her eyes to see them there, surrounding her bed, looking at her.<br><br>Asking her for help. <em>Begging </em>her for help.<br><br>"How can I help you...? Tell me," she asked aloud more than once.<br><br>But they never answered.<br><br>Of course not. They weren't real. They were symptoms of her own psychological stress and trauma.<br><br>They were dreams. Bad dreams.

The result of these varying felicities is a novel that is immediate, strikingly unpredictable, authentic, and convincing.&nbsp;</p></p><p>"<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> is the great American novel. Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's....

Sano Ichiro, the samurai detective who has risen to become the shogun's second-in-command, is investigating rumors of a plot to overthrow the ruling regime. When the investigation brings Sano's deputy Hirata to Lord Mori's estate, he is shocked to find Lord Mori murdered and grotesquely mutilated in his own bed, and Sano's pregnant wife, Reiko, lying beside him. The only solid clue is a chrysanthemum soaked in blood. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reiko's account of her actions is anything but solid. She insists that she went undercover to Lord Mori's estate in order to investigate claims that he molested and murdered young boys. But when Sano inspects the crime scene, he finds no trace of what Reiko described. And every other witness tells a different story: Lady Mori alleges that Reiko was Lord Mori's scorned mistress and murdered him for revenge. And Lord Mori himself, speaking through a medium, claims his murder was part of Sano's plot to overthrow the shogun! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless Sano can prove his wife's unlikely claims, both he and Reiko--and their unborn child--face execution for treason.

Coauthors Kisshomaru Ueshiba and Moriteru Ueshiba, son and grandson of the Founder, seek to carry on his legacy and to share with the millions of men and women around the world practicing Aikido today the most important techniques and principles of the art.<br><br>This book is the quintessential training aid for all Aikido practitioners-whether beginning or advanced-who wish to further their understanding of the forms and spirit of Aikido.<br><br>Underlying the forms, or physical techniques, are the spiritual principles of Aikido, which are based on the notion of ki, or "life force." Ki is the fundamental element to understanding Aikido. But as the authors explain, it cannot be learned merely by watching a demonstration or reading a book. Rather, one must come to experience it through practice, in unifying body and mind.<br><br><em>Best Aikido</em> helps guide the practitioner to this goal. It offers step-by-step instruction that will complement knowledge learned in the dojo. The text is illustrated with a wealth of never-before-seen photographs that feature Aikido master Moriteru Ueshiba demonstrating the fundamental techniques of the art.<br><br><em>Best Aikido</em> is authorized by the Aikikai Foundation, the central organization set up by Morihei Ueshiba.</p><p>Foreword <p>Best Aikido was written for the following reasons: Although it is a difficult concept for beginning students to understand, the techniques of Aikido are born from the harmonization between the human body and the universal energy (ki) of heaven and earth. Or more simply, all the various Aikido techniques are derived from the principle of natural movement. Since each and every Aikido technique has a special character, open to individual interpretation, the number of Aikido techniques is limitless. Thus, Aikido cannot be taught in strictly set patterns or put into a rigid system. This has been the approach to Aikido instruction since the art was established by the Founder, Morihei Ueshiba. </p><p>I received direct instruction from the Founder for many years, and thereafter worked in accordance with his wishes to promote Aikido. Aikido is now an art practiced internationally by millions of men and women, young and old, in many countries. </p><p>In order to establish the practice of Aikido even more widely, after careful consideration I selected, from the vast number of possibilities, the techniques most essential to the art. These techniques can be practiced by anyone, young or old, and will make it easier to train and achieve efficiency in the art. </p><p>Furthermore, Aikido contains many important principles as a martial art. It is my belief that these principles have universal validity, and the spirit behind Aikido techniques should be even more widely disseminated. </p><p>This book is not merely a technical manual. Such manuals only describe the outer form of Aikido. In this book, Aikido is presented as a spiritual path as well as a martial art. Best Aikido contains the essentials for understanding the art, the essentials for training, and the essential forms of Aikido. </p><p>I am pleased that this primer, Best Aikido, was co-authored with my son Moriteru, who is carrying on the tradition of developing and promoting Aikido, according to its true principles. We are entering a new era, and I welcome his full participation in the creation of the text and posing for the photographs demonstrating the techniques. It is my sincere hope that this book will aid all practitioners of the art in their further understanding of the form and spirit of Aikido, and facilitate their training. </p><p>August, 1997 <br>Kisshomaru Ueshiba</p><br>KISSHOMARU UESHIBA: the second Aikido Doshu (the person who embodies the spirit of Aikido as inherited from the founder and is the living symbol of Aikido).

IBM and the Holocaust provides a chilling investigation into corporate complicity, and the atrocities witnessed raise startling questions that throw IBM&#39;s wartime ethics into serious doubt. Edwin Black&#39;s monumental research exposes how IBM and its subsidiaries helped create enablling technologies for the Nazis, step-by-step, from the identification and cataloging programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s.</p><p>Was IBM, "The Solutions Company," partly responsible for the Final Solution? That's the question raised by Edwin Black's <i>IBM and the Holocaust</i>, the most controversial book on the subject since Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. Black, a son of Holocaust survivors, is less tendentiously simplistic than Goldhagen, but his thesis is no less provocative: he argues that IBM founder Thomas Watson deserved the Merit Cross (Germany's second-highest honor) awarded him by Hitler, his second-biggest customer on earth. "IBM, primarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler's program of Jewish destruction a technologic mission the company pursued with chilling success," writes Black. "IBM had almost single-handedly brought modern warfare into the information age [and] virtually put the 'blitz' in the <i>krieg</i>." <p> The crucial technology was a precursor to the computer, the IBM Hollerith punch card machine, which Black glimpsed on exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, inspiring his five-year, top-secret book project. The Hollerith was used to tabulate and alphabetize census data. Black says the Hollerith and its punch card data ("hole 3 signified homosexual ... hole 8 designated a Jew") was indispensable in rounding up prisoners, keeping the trains fully packed and on time, tallying the deaths, and organizing the entire war effort. Hitler's regime was fantastically, suicidally chaotic; could IBM have been the cause of its sole competence: mass-murdering civilians? Better scholars than I must sift through and appraise Black's mountainous evidence, but clearly the assessment is overdue.</p><p> The moral argument turns on one question: How much did IBM New York know about IBM Germany's work, and when? Black documents a scary game of brinksmanship orchestrated by IBM chief Watson, who walked a fine line between enraging U.S. officials and infuriating Hitler. He shamefully delayed returning the Nazi medal until forced to--and when he did return it, the Nazis almost kicked IBM and its crucial machines out of Germany. (Hitler was prone to self-defeating decisions, as demonstrated in <i>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</i>.) </p><p> Black has created a must-read work of history. But it's also a fascinating business book examining the colliding influences of personality, morality, and cold strategic calculation. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> is the stunning story of IBM's strategic alliance with Nazi Germany -- beginning in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continuing well into World War II. As the Third Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest and genocide, IBM and its subsidiaries helped create enabling technologies, step-by-step, from the identification and cataloging programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s. <br><br>Only after Jews were identified -- a massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done immediately -- could they be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, enslaved labor, and, ultimately, annihilation. It was a cross-tabulation and organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no computer existed. <br><br>But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist. Aided by the company's custom-designed and constantly updated Hollerith systems, Hitler was able to automate his persecution of the Jews. Historians have always been amazed at the speed and accuracy with which the Nazis were able to identify and locate European Jewry. Until now, the pieces of this puzzle have never been fully assembled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe, from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing programs to the running of railroads and organizing of concentration camp slave labor. <br><br>IBM and its German subsidiary custom-designed complex solutions, one by one, anticipating the Reich's needs. They did not merely sell the machines and walk away. Instead, IBM leased these machines for high fees and became the sole source of the billions of punch cards Hitler needed.<br><br><b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> takes you through the carefully crafted corporate collusion with the Third Reich, as well as the structured deniability of oral agreements, undated letters, and the Geneva intermediaries -- all undertaken as the newspapers blazed with accounts of persecution and destruction. <br><br>Just as compelling is the human drama of one of our century's greatest minds, IBM founder Thomas Watson, who cooperated with the Nazis for the sake of profit. <br><br>Only with IBM's technologic assistance was Hitler able to achieve the staggering numbers of the Holocaust. Edwin Black has now uncovered one of the last great mysteries of Germany's war against the Jews -- how did Hitler get the names?</p><h2>Progress of Another Pilgrim:</h2><p>This sequel to Come Away My Beloved boasts more than 175 of the invigorating spiritual writings for which Frances J.

The calendar became a cult hit, and thus the book was born so that even more of these unparalleled images could be savored. <br>Whether or not rugby will become more popular in this country remains to be seen, but this book will certainly raise the game&#x2019;s profile...</p><p>Fran�ois Rousseau was born in France in 1967. He spent ten years as an artist before beginning his photography career in 1995. Since then, his work has been commissioned by numerous magazines in Paris. He often incorporates athletes, musicians and artists in his photos and currently alternates between commercial fashion photography and art photography.</p><h2>The Monuments of Ancient Egypt: As Commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte</h2><p>In 1801 the army of Napoleon invaded Egypt. In the course of his conquest, he commissioned a team of architectural engineers to conduct a survey of the monuments and artifacts discovered there. The result was to significantly change the way scholars and scientists viewed the world and give rise to the study of Egyptology. All of their meticulously drawn plates pertaining to Egyptian antiquities have been reproduced in this extraordinary volume. Temples, monuments, hieroglyphs and plans of sites have been rendered with remarkable detail. It was on this expedition that the Rosetta Stone, which turned out to be the key to decoding hieroglyphics, was discovered. An introduction by the Princeton professor, Charles Coulston Gillipsie provides context and background to more than 480 pages of plates.</p><p></p><h2>Naples &#39;44</h2><p>As a young intelligence officer stationed in Naples following its liberation from Nazi forces, Norman Lewis recorded the lives of a proud and vibrant people forced to survive on prostitution, thievery, and a desperate belief in miracles and cures. The most popular of Lewis&#39;s twenty-seven books, Naples &#39;44 is a landmark poetic study of the agony of wartime occupation and its ability to bring out the worst, and often the best, in human nature. In prose both heartrending and comic, Lewis describes an era of disillusionment, escapism, and hysteria in which the Allied occupiers mete out justice unfairly and fail to provide basic necessities to the populace while Neapolitan citizens accuse each other of being Nazi spies, women offer their bodies to the same Allied soldiers whose supplies they steal for sale on the black market, and angry young men organize militias to oppose &#34;temporary&#34; foreign rule. Yet over the chaotic din, Lewis sings intimately of the essential dignity of the Neapolitan people, whose traditions of civility, courage, and generosity of spirit shine through daily. This essential World War II book is as timely a read as ever.</p><p>Norman Lewis is Britain&#39;s greatest living travel writer, with a list of some 10 travel books and several books of collected journalism to his name. However Lewis regards his greatest achievement to have been the reaction to his article Genocide in Brazil, published in The Sunday Times in 1968. It led to a change in Brazilian law relating to the treatment of the Indians and to the formation of Survival International which fights for the survival of indigenous peoples everywhere.&#34;One goes on reading page after page like eating cherries.&#34;</p><h2>Complex Variables and Applications, Second Edition</h2><p>297 pp Copyright 1948 McGraw-Hill This 2nd edition copyright 1960</p><p></p><h2>A Guide Book Of United States Paper Money: Complete Source for History, Grading, and Prices (Official Red Book)</h2><p>Building on the comprehensive scope of the classic Friedberg text, Q.

Rowling. (s05).</p><p>Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England.

But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.</p><h2>Buddhism, Sexuality, and Gender</h2><p>This book explores historical, textual, and social questions relating to the position and experience of women and gay people in the Buddhist world from India and Tibet to Sri Lanka, China, and Japan. It focuses on four key areas: Buddhist history, contemporary culture, Buddhist symbols, and homosexuality, and it covers Buddhism&#x2019;s entire history, from its origins to the present day. The result of original and innovative research, the author offers new perspectives on the history of the attitudes toward, and of the self-perception of, women in both ancient and modern Buddhist societies. He explores key social issues such as abortion, he examines the use of rhetoric and symbols in Buddhist texts and cultures, and he discusses the neglected subject of Buddhism and homosexuality.</p><p><p>Jos� Ignacio Cabez�n is Assistant Professor of Philosophy of Religion at Iliff School of Theology in Denver.

His language was perfect, without a flaw and without hesitation, each sentence spoken effortlessly, with no pause for thought. People who attended these lectures testified to a transformation in which the doctor appeared to grow visibly, his face taking quite a different expression and radiating light.

Hirsch isn&#x2019;t just a disgraced cop; the internal investigations bureau is still trying to convict him of something, even if it means planting evidence. When someone leaves a pistol cartridge in his mailbox, Hirsch suspects that his career isn't the only thing on the line.<br>&nbsp; <br>But the tiny town of Tiverton has more crime than one lone cop should have to handle. The stagnant economy, rural isolation, and entrenched racism and misogyny mean every case Hirsch investigates is a new basket of snakes.

You been sitting on your arse for three weeks, or have you been poking around like I asked?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Poking around, Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You can cover a lot of ground in that time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I told you, didn&#x2019;t I, no dropkicks?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Loud and clear, Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No dropkicks on my watch,&#x201d; Sergeant Kropp said, &#x201c;and no smartarses.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He switched gears, telling Hirsch that a woman motorist had called it in. &#x201c;No name mentioned, on her way to view the wildflowers, heard shots when she pulled over to photograph the Tin Hut.&#x201d; Kropp paused. &#x201c;You with me, the Tin Hut?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch didn&#x2019;t have a clue. &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So get your arse out there, let me know what you find.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Could be someone&#x2019;s idea of a joke,&#x201d; the sergeant said, &#x201c;and this is farming country, the sheep-shaggers like to take pot-shots at rabbits, but you never know.&#x201d;<br><br>Wheat and wool country, in fact, three hours north of Adelaide, Hirsch&#x2019;s new posting a single-officer police station in a blink-and-you&#x2019;d-miss-it town on the Barrier Highway. There were still a few of these little cop shops around the state, the Department knowing not to call them one-man stations, not in this day and age, or not in print or in range of a microphone, but it didn&#x2019;t place female officers in them all the same, citing<br>safety and operational concerns. So, single guys were sent to Tiverton (the wives of married officers would take one look and say no thanks)&#x2014;often, or especially, guys with a stink clinging to them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Hirsch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police station was the front room of a small brick house right on the highway, where flies droned and sluggish winds stirred the dusty community notices. Hirsch lived in the three rooms behind it: bathroom, sitting room with alcove kitchen, bedroom. He also enjoyed a parched front lawn, a narrow driveway for his own aged Nissan and the SA Police fleet vehicle, a four-wheel-drive Toyota Hi Lux mounted with a rear cage, and a storeroom at the back, its barred window and reinforced door dating from pre- death-in-custody days, when it had been the lockup. And for all of these bounties the Department screwed him on the rent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finishing the call with Sergeant Kropp, Hirsch located Bitter Wash Road on the wall map, locked up, pinned his mobile number to the front door and backed out of the driveway. He passed the general store first, just along from the police station and opposite the primary school, the playground still and silent, the kids on holiday, then a couple of old stone houses, the Institute with its weathered cannon and memorial to the dead of the world wars, more houses, two churches, an agricultural supplier, a signposted grain dealer down a side street . . . and that was Tiverton. No bank, chemist, medical practice, lawyer, dentist, accountant or high school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove south along the floor of a shallow valley, undulating and partly cultivated hills on his left, a more dramatic and distant range on his right&#x2014;blue today, scarred here and there by scrubby trees and shadows among erupted rocks, a foretaste of the Flinders Ranges, three hours further north. In the fashion of the locals, Hirsch lifted one finger from the steering wheel to greet the oncoming cars, all two of them. Nothing else<br>moved. He was travelling through a land poised for movement: birds watched him from the power lines as if snipped from tin, farmhouses crouched mutely behind cypress hedges, and farm vehicles sat immobile in paddocks, waiting for him to pass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five kilometres south of Tiverton he turned left at the Bitter Wash turnoff, heading east into the hills, and here there was some movement in the world. Stones smacked the chassis. Skinny sheep fled, a dog snarled at a fence line, crows rose untidily from a flattened sleepy lizard. The road turned and rose and fell, taking him deeper into pretty but hardscrabble country, just inside the rain shadow. He passed a tumbled stone wall dating from the 1880s, a couple of massive perfect gumtrees, a wind farm turbine. Someone had been planting trees up and down one of the gullies, to combat erosion. Then Hirsch remembered to check kilometres travelled since the turnoff, and wondered when he&#x2019;d come upon the hut his sergeant was talking about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slowed for a dip in the road, water running shallowly across it from last night&#x2019;s storm, and accelerated uphill, over a peak and around a blind corner and jammed on the brakes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gumtree branch the length of a power pole lay across Bitter Wash Road. Hirsch switched off, his heart hammering. Close shave. Beyond the obstacle the road dipped again, bottoming out where a creek in weak, muddy flood had scored a shallow trench in the gravel, then it climbed to another blind corner. And in a little cleared area inside the fence and alongside the creek, was Sergeant Kropp&#x2019;s Tin Hut: corrugated iron walls and roof, mostly rust colored, and a crooked chimney. On a flat above it he glimpsed trees and the suggestion of a green farmhouse roof.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch got out. He was reaching to drag the branch off the road when a bullet snapped past his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first and natural instinct was to duck, his second to scuttle around to the lee side of the Hi Lux, drawing his service pistol, a S&amp;W 40 calibre semi-automatic. His first <i>thought</i> was that Kropp&#x2019;s anonymous caller had got it right. But then, crouched<br>there beside the grubby rear wheel, Hirsch began to have a second thought: two days earlier, some arsehole had placed a pistol cartridge in his letterbox, and it occurred to him now that it hadn&#x2019;t been a joke or a threat but a promise. He weighed his options: call for backup; tackle the shooter; get the hell out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the choice had been made for him. The cunts had trapped him where the road dipped between a canola crop and a stony hill. As soon as he showed himself&#x2014;as soon as he got behind the wheel or clambered uphill to find the shooter or climbed the fence to run through the canola&#x2014;he&#x2019;d be shot. Meanwhile, police backup was in Redruth, forty kilometres away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch&#x2019;s mind stopped racing and settled on one thought: the shooters were the very officers he hoped might back him up. They were not forty kilometres but forty metres away, up there on the hillside, positioned for a crossfire, their radios conveniently switched off. Redruth was a three-man station, Kropp and two constables, and when Hirsch had called in to introduce himself, three weeks ago, they&#x2019;d called him a dog, a maggot. They&#x2019;d mouthed <i>pow!</i> as they finger-shot their temples, grinned<br>as they finger-sliced their throats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed a pistol cartridge in his letterbox when his back was turned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch thought about it some more. Even if he managed to climb inside the Hi Lux again, the tree was still across the road, there was nowhere to turn around and they&#x2019;d shoot him through the glass. Discounting a full-on, up-hill assault, that left a zigzagging escape into the canola crop, a broad yellow swathe stretching to the smoky hills on the other side of the valley&#x2014;but to reach it he&#x2019;d first have to climb the bank and then tangle himself in a wire fence, and how much cover would the crop provide?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch began to feel jittery, a strange discordancy of his<br>senses. He might have put it down to fear, but it was more a kind of illness. Some emanation from the wind farm? He was very close to one of the turbines. It sat on the stony hill where the shooter was hiding, the first of a ragged line stretching along this side of the valley, and the blades were cutting the air in a steady, rhythmic whooshing that reached deep in his guts. To Hirsch, it was all of a piece with ending his days where the world was unlovely, at the base of a scruffy slope of grass tussocks, rabbit<br>holes and licheny stone reefs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced both ways along the road. He didn&#x2019;t know where the next farmhouses were or how much traffic to expect, or . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ, traffic. Hirsch cocked an ear, listening for vehicles he&#x2019;d have to warn off, or protect, or mop the collateral blood from. Or fear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which raised the question: Why would the bastards ambush him here, within cooee of town? Why not somewhere more remote, like &#x201c;out east&#x201d;&#x2014;as the locals called it. According to the calendar hanging above Hirsch&#x2019;s desk, &#x201c;out east&#x201d; was a region of undernourished mallee scrub, red dirt, nude stone chimneys, mine shafts, rock art, September wildflowers and one jagged hill named the Razorback.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September school holidays, wildflowers blooming . . . Hirsch listened again, imagining he could hear a busload of tourists trundling along Bitter Wash Road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He risked a quick glance over the passenger door windowsill. The radio handset jutted from a cradle on the dashboard. His phone, a Motorola Defy, sat in a drinks holder between the front seats. He wasn&#x2019;t obliged to call the Redruth station. He could call Peterborough, Clare, even Adelaide . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next shot came.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch froze, fingers on the door handle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he relaxed minutely. He analysed what it was he&#x2019;d heard. Not a high-powered crack but something flat, puny, small calibre, dampened further by the huge sky above and the whoosh of the turbine blades. Hardly what you&#x2019;d expect of a sniping rifle, and it had been accompanied by a weak howl as the bullet hit an obstacle&#x2014;a stone?&#x2014;and whanged away across the creek.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowhere near him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>second</i> ricochet came. He stiffened again, relaxed again. Not a ricochet, nor an echo, but a young voice saying <i>peeowww. </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch did what he should have done from the start and eyed the fallen branch. No drag marks in the gravel, no saw or axe cuts, excess foliage still intact. He eyed the tree itself. The wound was half way up the trunk, and he recalled camping trips from his childhood, the teachers warning the kids not to pitch their tents under gum trees. All that sinewy health on the outside and quiet decay within.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He holstered his handgun and, hunching his shoulders a little, stepped into the middle of the road and dragged the branch into the ditch. Then he parked the Hi Lux on a narrow verge, leaving room for passing vehicles, and climbed the scabby hill to see who might have put him in his grave if his luck hadn&#x2019;t been running.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t hear his approach, the boy and the girl: the<br>wind, the rhythmic rush of the turbine above their heads, their<br>absolute absorption as one kid aimed a .22 at a jam tin on a rock<br>and the other stood by to watch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch knew he should pounce on them before they sent another ricochet over the road, but he paused. The view from the base of the turbine was panoramic, exhilarating, and Bitter Wash Road was clear in both directions, so he took a moment to get his bearings. The broad valley, the vigorous crops, the road running up and down the folds in the earth. And that khaki smudge back there was Tiverton with its pale grain silos poking into the haze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a farmhouse above the Tin Hut, the green roof clearly visible now, and on the other side of the road was a redroofed house. Trees and cypresses hedged them in, shrubberies and garden beds and lawns, the usual landscaping out here in the wheat and wool country, but the green-roofed property was extensive, with a number of sheds, a set of stockyards and farm vehicles parked on a dirt clearing beside a haystack, while the red roof was small, faded, boasting only an attached carport and one small garden shed. Hirsch wondered at the relationship between the two properties. Maybe a farm manager lived in the smaller house. Or a &#x201c;couple&#x2019;, a man to do the gardening, his<br>wife to cook and clean. The shit work. Or maybe those feudal relationships no longer existed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch shaded his eyes. The sun passed in and out of the scrappy clouds, a crow sideslipped above the road, sparrowhawks hunted above the creek, sheep trotted nose to tail along a dirt pad on a nearby hillside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise only the children moved, and Hirsch was betting they belonged to one or both of the houses. No school for two weeks, and, with the blessing or ignorance of their parents, they&#x2019;d taken a .22 rifle out for some target shooting. The location was perfect: nothing here but grass and stones, sloping down to the creek, nothing with blood in its veins, yet you could pretend you were in a shootout with the bad guys, and when the rifle grew too heavy for your little arms you could prop the barrel on a rock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except that bullets strike objects and howl off in unexpected directions. Or you might forget where you are and take a pot-shot at a crow or a rabbit just when a policeman is stepping out of his Hi Lux to shift a fallen tree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, well, wasn&#x2019;t this just great? A couple of adults he could deal with: clear regulations, clear offences and penalties. But kids . . . He&#x2019;d have to involve the parents; he&#x2019;d maybe have to charge the parents.

Now they heard him, his curses and the tock and rattle of stones tumbling over one another, Hirsch cursing because he&#x2019;d frightened himself, torn his trousers and barked the skin on palm and elbow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children whirled around in shared alarm, mouths open, eyes shocked. They were caught in the act, and they knew it, but it was how they managed it that mattered, and Hirsch, forgetting his discomfort, was intrigued to see divergent reactions.

Garver was the founding director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, California and the director of the Madison Art Center in Madison, Wisconsin. Other positions have included assistant director of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University and Curator of Exhibitions of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.*Starred Review* Once you&#x2019;ve seen a George Tooker painting, you won&#x2019;t soon forget it, but&nbsp;Tooker&#x2019;s life and work are not well known. This gap in American art history is&nbsp;splendidly redressed in this&nbsp;volume of lustrous reproductions and&nbsp;informative biographical and critical essays published in conjunction with the first Tooker retrospective in three decades. Born in 1920, Tooker has long been influenced by his love of literature, passion for Renaissance art, and spirituality. After finding a place within a circle of fellow gay artists and writers, including Paul Cadmus, Lincoln Kirstein, and W. H. Auden, Tooker left New York and the postwar action-painting&nbsp;vortex for Vermont, where he still works&nbsp;in the unforgiving medium of egg tempera, creating empathic, haunting paintings of people literally or figuratively boxed in and isolated, such as his most famous work, Subway (1950), in which wary women and men navigate prisonlike halls. Sensitive to prejudice and injustice, concerned with alienation and other maladies of the soul,&nbsp;and critical of corporate culture, Tooker describes his freshly germane work as &#x201c;protest paintings.&#x201d; Attuned to life&#x2019;s mysteries, sorrows, and beauty, Tooker is also a painter of light and love. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>To Rule the Night: The Discovery Voyage of Astronaut Jim Irwin</h2><p>A thrilling account of one of the greatest adventures of all time..man&#39;s journey to the moon.

To leisurely travel about the Continent, take in a few antiquities, and--of course--purchase fabulous Parisian wardrobes.<br> <br>But once they arrive in France, mysterious things start to happen. Cecy receives a package containing a lost coronation treasure, Thomas's valet is assaulted, and Kate loses a glove. Soon it becomes clear that they have stumbled upon a dastardly, magical plot to take over Europe. <br> <br>Now the four newlyweds must embark on a daring chase to thwart the evil conspiracy. And there's no telling the trouble they'll get into along the way. For when you mix Kate and Cecy <i>and </i>magic, you never know what's going to happen next!<br></p><p>In this elegant, old-fashioned rambler, a sequel to the historical fantasy <i>Sorcery and Cecilia</i>, a party of five Brits (three of them are wizards)--Kate and Thomas Schofield, Cecy and James Tarleton, and Lady Sylvia--takes a "grand tour" of 19th-century Europe. What promises to be a pleasant exploration of old world antiquities and fancy shops turns out to be an adventure of a lifetime when Cecy receives a mysterious alabaster flask (a coronation treasure) from an agitated Lady in Blue. Before they know it, they are wrapped up in a magical conspiracy to take over Europe.<p> Written in two voices by two different authors, the novel alternates between Cecy's deposition and excerpts from her dear friend and cousin Kate's diary. Despite the crisp, clever dialogue and wonderful character subtleties in this Jane Austen-style comedy of manners, readers may be confused by the episodic nature of the novel whose mysteries take their sweet time in unfolding. Teens with the patience to savor this slow-as-molasses grand tour, however, will be amply rewarded by the novel's myriad delights.

The story follows an abandoned young boy who wanders alone through the frozen bogs and broken towns of Eastern Europe during and after World War II, trying to survive. His experiences and actions occur at and beyond the limits of what might be called humanity, but Kosinski never averts his eyes, nor allows us to.FRED BERMAN is an award-winning audiobook performer.

The rewards of this research, some of it as spectacular as what was once thought of as science fiction, are practically in our grasp. Already it is possible to analyze our individual genetic makeups and evaluate our predisposition for breast cancer or other deadly diseases on a case-by-case basis. And once we've isolated these genes, the ability to repress or enhance them through biotechnology is just around the corner. Soon, for example, it will be feasible for 10% of our red blood cells to be replaced by artificial cells, radically extending our life expectancy and enhancing our physical and even mental abilities beyond what is humanly possible today. In <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>, Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman will show us how amazingly advanced we are in our medical technology, and how incredibly far each of us can go toward living as long as we dare imagine.<br><br>With today's mind-bending array of scientific knowledge, it is possible to prevent nearly 90% of the maladies that kill us, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and liver disease. Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman start the reader on a fantastic journey to undreamed-of vitality with a comprehensive investigation into the cutting-edge science on diet, metabolism, genetics, toxins and detoxification, the hormones involved with aging and youth, exercise, stress reduction, and more. By following their program, which includes such simple recommendations as drinking alkaline water and taking specific nutritional supplements to enhance your immune system and slow the aging process on a cellular level, anyone will be able to immediately add years of healthy, active living to his life.</p><p>The idea behind Kurzweil and Grossman's <i>Fantastic Voyage</i> is that if you can make it through the next 50 years, you might become immortal. How will that be possible? Through some rather science fictional steps, it turns out, including taking advantage of the latest in biotechnological breakthroughs and not-yet-invented nanotechnology. Is all this longing for immortality driven by an obsession with youth or a fear of death? Readers can judge for themselves, as both Kurzweil and Grossman reveal the personal histories that led them to develop this plan. <i>Fantastic Voyage</i> is written in an easy-to-understand tone, with lots of sidebars giving examples of what the future holds for medicine and health. Whether or not you think that science will find a way to keep our bodies or our disembodied minds alive forever, this book is full of diet and lifestyle tips. For instance, the authors suggest carefully controlling the body's overall pH at an alkaline level, meditating, eating a diet composed mostly of vegetables and protein, and taking loads of supplements (Kurzweil downs about 250 pills each day). The dietary options presented here will mostly only be practical for people whose income levels can support buying organic produce, fresh fish and meat, and top-shelf supplements. The authors cavalierly state that we are living in a "time of abundance," but it seems likely that most who are able to follow this regimen will be Americans of a fairly high socioeconomic class. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Ray Kurzweil, Ph.D.</b>, is one of the world's leading entrepreneurs, thinkers, and futurists.

The book is illustrated with vividly colored, dynamic watercolor paintings. Each two-page spread features a large painting of one stage in the large mountain's development plus a smaller, rectangular painting of Elizabeth working diligently on her sand mountain superimposed on it. Each left-hand page describes a stage in the mountain's development, while each right-hand page describes Elizabeth's work, attempting to show how both mountains are affected by the forces of sun, wind, and rain. The scientific information given is simple but accurate; however, very young children will not have the background information to absorb the analogy presented. In some pictures the mountain is shown cross-sectioned with inner layers exposed, but the text doesn't explain what the ``stripes'' represent, why they are there, or that such layers are found through the earth. Similarly, there is no generalization from the story of this unique mountain to earth's geology in general. Children at different levels will understand different aspects of this presentation; children old enough to best appreciate the analogy may be put off by the picture book format. However, this striking picture book deserves shelf space as a book for children to share individually with an adult available to explain and interpret, or as a companion book to amplify and illustrate a primary grade geology unit.

His works form the core of more than two thousand years of Oriental civilization, and even today, when he has been officially discarded, his thought remains important for understanding the present as well as the past. Yet Confucius is the property of not only the Orientalists: his ideas stood behind much of the rational social thought of the European Enlightenment, as great philosophers from Leibnitz on seized with delight "the perfect ethic without supernaturalism: that China offered them.<br>The present edition of the wisdom of Confucius is certainly the best edition ever prepared in the West. The results of many years of study in China by the great Sinologist James Legge, it contains the entire Chinese text of the <i>Analects</i> (or sayings) of Confucius in large, readable characters, and beneath this Legge's full translation, which has been accepted as the definitive, standard English version. The book also includes <i>The Great Learning</i> and <i>The Doctrine of the Mean</i>.<br>In addition to the texts and translation, a wealth of helpful material is offered to the reader: countless notes embodying textual studies, commentators' opinions, interpretation of individual characters, disputed meanings, and similar material. More than 125 pages of introduction cover the Chinese classics, the history of the texts in this volume, and the life and influence of Confucius. Most useful, too, is a complete dictionary of all the Chinese characters in the book, with meanings, grammatical comments, place locations, and similar data.

Each story delivers universal truths about family unity, respect, grief, and overcoming challenges.</p><p>LORETTA OUTWATER COX is an Inupiaq woman, born in Nome, Alaska, and raised in various villages around the Seward Peninsula. She holds a bachelor&#39;s degree in education and a master&#39;s degree in education administration. Loretta taught school in western Alaska for twenty-three years. She and her husband, Skip, have three children and three grandchildren.Adult/High School-Hailed as <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> of the Arctic, this novel captures the world of the Inupiaq of Alaska. Interwoven with the depiction of Cox's great-grandmother's daily activities are the oral stories of her ancestors. These tales have been kept alive by a group of women who meet regularly during the dark months to share stories. The storyteller weaves the story while the other participants carefully draw symbols, lines, or shapes that help them to remember it. The book is set in the 1920s, but the tales are from the women's youth, around the late 1800s. The stories range from the everyday-favorite recipes-to legends of giants and spiders that live among the people. They are lessons in history, both because these are women who never learned to read and write, and because they record the history of the Alaskan Indians. Their power is that they contain universal themes: family unity, respect for others, welcoming strangers, building up the weak, overcoming difficulty, and wrestling with grief. Readers will learn about the federal government's plan to bring education to the people of Alaska and how the Indians responded. In the end, teens will appreciate the difficulty of life in the far North.<i>-Erin Dennington, Chantilly Regional Library, Fairfax County, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I had made no changes to that file in May. I had made no changes to that file since I wrote the words, in January 2004, a day or two or three after the fact.<br><br>For a long time I wrote nothing else.<br><br><i>Life changes in the instant.</i><br><br><i>The ordinary instant.</i><br><br>At some point, in the interest of remembering what seemed most striking about what had happened, I considered adding those words, &#x201c;the ordinary instant.&#x201d; I saw immediately that there would be no need to add the word &#x201c;ordinary,&#x201d; because there would be no forgetting it: the word never left my mind. It was in fact the ordinary nature of everything preceding the event that prevented me from truly believing it had happened, absorbing it, incorporating it, getting past it. I recognize now that there was nothing unusual in this: confronted with sudden disaster we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable occurred, the clear blue sky from which the plane fell, the routine errand that ended on the shoulder with the car in flames, the swings where the children were playing as usual when the rattlesnake struck from the ivy. &#x201c;He was on his way home from work&#x2014;happy, successful, healthy&#x2014;and then, gone,&#x201d; I read in the account of a psychiatric nurse whose husband was killed in a highway accident. In 1966 I happened to interview many people who had been living in Honolulu on the morning of December 7, 1941; without exception, these people began their accounts of Pearl Harbor by telling me what an &#x201c;ordinary Sunday morning&#x201d; it had been. &#x201c;It was just an ordinary beautiful September day,&#x201d; people still say when asked to describe the morning in New York when American Airlines 11 and United Airlines 175 got flown into the World Trade towers. Even the report of the 9/11 Commission opened on this insistently premonitory and yet still dumbstruck narrative note: &#x201c;Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then&#x2014;gone.&#x201d; <i>In the midst of life we are in death</i>, Episcopalians say at the graveside. Later I realized that I must have repeated the details of what happened to everyone who came to the house in those first weeks, all those friends and relatives who brought food and made drinks and laid out plates on the dining room table for however many people were around at lunch or dinner time, all those who picked up the plates and froze the leftovers and ran the dishwasher and filled our (I could not yet think <i>my</i>) otherwise empty house even after I had gone into the bedroom (our bedroom, the one in which there still lay on a sofa a faded terrycloth XL robe bought in the 1970s at Richard Carroll in Beverly Hills) and shut the door. Those moments when I was abruptly overtaken by exhaustion are what I remember most clearly about the first days and weeks. I have no memory of telling anyone the details, but I must have done so, because everyone seemed to know them. At one point I considered the possibility that they had picked up the details of the story from one another, but immediately rejected it: the story they had was in each instance too accurate to have been passed from hand to hand. It had come from me.<br><br>Another reason I knew that the story had come from me was that no version I heard included the details I could not yet face, for example the blood on the living room floor that stayed there until Jos� came in the next morning and cleaned it up.<br><br>Jos�. Who was part of our household. Who was supposed to be flying to Las Vegas later that day, December 31, but never went. Jos� was crying that morning as he cleaned up the blood. When I first told him what had happened he had not understood. Clearly I was not the ideal teller of this story, something about my version had been at once too offhand and too elliptical, something in my tone had failed to convey the central fact in the situation (I would encounter the same failure later when I had to tell Quintana), but by the time Jos� saw the blood he understood.<br><br>I had picked up the abandoned syringes and ECG electrodes before he came in that morning but I could not face the blood.<br><br>In outline.<br><br>It is now, as I begin to write this, the afternoon of October 4, 2004.<br><br>Nine months and five days ago, at approximately nine o&#x2019;clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child, Quintana, had been for the previous five nights unconscious in an intensive care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center&#x2019;s Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed in August 2004) more commonly known as &#x201c;Beth Israel North&#x201d; or &#x201c;the old Doctors&#x2019; Hospital,&#x201d; where what had seemed a case of December flu sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself. I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be penetrable, if only for myself.<br>2.<br><br>December 30, 2003, a Tuesday.<br><br>We had seen Quintana in the sixth-floor ICU at Beth Israel North.<br><br>We had come home.<br><br>We had discussed whether to go out for dinner or eat in.<br><br>I said I would build a fire, we could eat in.<br><br>I built the fire, I started dinner, I asked John if he wanted a drink.<br><br>I got him a Scotch and gave it to him in the living room, where he was reading in the chair by the fire where he habitually sat.<br><br>The book he was reading was by David Fromkin, a bound galley of <i>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?</i><br><br>I finished getting dinner, I set the table in the living room where, when we were home alone, we could eat within sight of the fire. I find myself stressing the fire because fires were important to us. I grew up in California, John and I lived there together for twenty-four years, in California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in. Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night. I lit the candles. John asked for a second drink before sitting down. I gave it to him. We sat down. My attention was on mixing the salad.<br><br>John was talking, then he wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>At one point in the seconds or minute before he stopped talking he had asked me if I had used single-malt Scotch for his second drink. I had said no, I used the same Scotch I had used for his first drink. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why but I don&#x2019;t think you should mix them.&#x201d; At another point in those seconds or that minute he had been talking about why World War One was the critical event from which the entire rest of the twentieth century flowed.<br><br>I have no idea which subject we were on, the Scotch or World War One, at the instant he stopped talking.<br><br>I only remember looking up. His left hand was raised and he was slumped motionless. At first I thought he was making a failed joke, an attempt to make the difficulty of the day seem manageable.<br><br>I remember saying <i>Don&#x2019;t do that</i>.<br><br>When he did not respond my first thought was that he had started to eat and choked.

The terrifying new order instituted by Frankie and her offbeat goon squad (led by her devoted hairdresser and including her own son-in-law) is an awesome spectacle to behold. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brimming with snappy dialogue and gleeful obscenity, <i>Ride a Cockhorse</i> is a rollicking cautionary tale of small-town demagoguery that might be seen to prefigure both America&#x2019;s current financial woes and the rise of Sarah Palin.

Upcoming collaborations include an original fairy tale about a lonely princess who decides to become a hairdresser. They live in Utah with their nine children.Not since Frosty paraded through the village square have snowmen enjoyed such a slip-sliding good time as they do in the Buehners' (Fanny's Dream) latest flight of fancy. When a boy observes that the snowman he built the day before now looks droopy and disheveled, he imagines what happened to his snow creation during the night. Soon the boy pictures all the neighborhood snowmen gathered in the park for "ice-cold cocoa," a snowball fight, a round of making snow angels and more. Surely a full night of play and a long glide back to their homes must be the explanation. The rhythm of the rhyming text sometimes matches the rollicking spirit of the snowmen's wintry pursuits, but occasionally stumbles: "Then the snowman games begin: They line up in their places,/ each one anxious for his turn in the snowman races." The glee comes through at its most infectious in Mark Buehner's oil-and-acrylic paintings of the merrymakers, who look so delighted in their revelry that readers won't be able to help smiling in response. Bringing the brisk snap of the season to the fore, his scenes feature a natural light show, depicting an inky night sky and fluffy snow that glistens beneath moonlight and (street) lamplight, and eventually, the gradual brightening of dawn. Children will like being in on the secret here and eagle-eye readers will relish finding hidden figures in the shadows, clouds and snowdrifts.

To the division's front lay a low, loaf-shaped hill. It looked no different from other hills seized with relative ease over the past few days. But this hill, soon to be dubbed, Sugar Loaf, was very different indeed. Part of a complex of three hills, Sugar Loaf formed the western anchor of General Mitsuru Ushijima's Shuri Line, which stretched from coast to coast across the island. Sugar Loaf was critical to the defense of that line, preventing U.S. forces from turning the Japanese flank. Over the next week, the Marines made repeated attacks on the hill losing thousands of men to death, wounds, and combat fatigue. Not until May 18 was Sugar Loaf finally seized. Two days later, the Japanese mounted a battalion-sized counterattack in an effort to regain their lost position, but the Marines held.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, these losses may not have been necessary. General Lemuel Shepherd, Jr., had argued for an amphibious assault to the rear of the Japanese defense line, but his proposal was rejected by U.S. Tenth Army Commander General Simon Bolivar Buckner.

When Annie asks what she can do to be able to work in peace, Cora Lee asks for a cake so rich and so sweet, it will fill me up and bring tears to my eyes. A cake like one...no one ever made for me. Annie bakes one good cake after another but doesn't discover the right one until she does some research at the library. Finally, Annie produces a birthday cake, and her present to Cora Lee is to call the shop Washington &amp; Merriweather.

Consequently, she spends her days alone and unapproachable in her apartment, taking long nighttime walks, and watching the kids who congregate at the local community center to smoke and mess around. One of those kids is her neighbor Barney Roberts, an amiable but obviously troubled preteen, whose single-parent father is clueless when it comes to the needs of his son. In the meantime, five young boys who have gone missing in South London have begun to turn up&#x2014;�exsanguinated and, of course, very, very dead. When Lacey&#x2019;s midnight forays put her in proximity to one of the murders, she becomes a suspect, though it takes Barney&#x2019;s disappearance to make her react; but by then it may be too late to help her young friend. Bolton sets aside the gothic-tinged atmosphere of her early novels in favor of a more visceral sensibility, exerting immediate and continuing pull by stepping in and out of an unnamed killer&#x2019;s mind. Couple the strong narrative drive with a pair of dysfunctional but surprisingly sympathetic characters, and you have a nail-biting thriller that will send readers back to Bolton&#x2019;s previous books and, of course, have them lining up for whatever the author comes up with next. --Stephanie Zvirin</p><h2>My Inventions</h2><p>Initially published as six articles in the <i>Electrical Experimenter </i>magazine, <i>My Inventions</i> is the autobiography of the visionary inventor Nikola Tesla.

But in an unlikely series of events, two young oil tycoons started their own professional football franchises in Dallas the very same year: the NFL&#x2019;s Dallas Cowboys, and, as part of a new upstart league designed to thwart the NFL&#x2019;s hold on the game, the Dallas Texans of the AFL. Almost overnight, a bitter feud was born.<br><br>The team owners, Lamar Hunt and Clint Murchison, became Mad Men of the gridiron, locked in a battle for the hearts and minds of the Texas pigskin faithful. Their teams took each other to court, fought over players, undermined each other&#x2019;s promotions, and rooted like hell for the other guys to fail. A true visionary, Hunt of the Texans focused on the fans, putting together a team of local legends and hiring attractive women to drive around town in red convertibles selling tickets. Meanwhile, Murchison and his Cowboys focused on the game, hiring a young star, Tom Landry, in what would be his first-ever year as a head coach, and concentrating on holding their own against the more established teams in the NFL. Ultimately, both teams won the battle, but only one got to stay in Dallas and go on to become one of sports&#x2019; most quintessential franchises&#x2014;&#x201c;America's Team.&#x201d;<br><br>In this highly entertaining narrative, rich in colorful characters and unforgettable stunts, Eisenberg recounts the story of the birth of pro football in Dallas&#x2014;back when the game began to be part of this country&#x2019;s DNA.</p><p>Advance Praise for Ten-Gallon War<br><br>&#x201c;Historians espouse the popular notion that the television age triggered the NFL explosion.

It takes Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose and their niece, Rachel, on a sea voyage from London to a resort on the South american coast. �&#x201c;It is a strange, tragic, inspired book whose scene is a South americanca not found on any map and reached by a boat which would not float on any sea, an americanca whose spiritual boundaries touch Xanadu and Atlantis�&#x201d; (E. M. Forster).</p><p>The Modern Library is proud to include Virginia Woolf's first novel, The Voyage Out--together with a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham. Published to acclaim in England in 1915 and in America five years later, The Voyage Out marks Woolf's beginning as one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and prolific writers. <br>Less formally experimental than her later novels, The Voyage Out none-theless clearly lays bare the poetic style and innovative technique--with its multiple figures of consciousness, its detailed portraits of characters' inner lives, and its constant shifting between the quotidian and the profound--that are the signature of Woolf's fiction. <br>Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's first heroine, is a motherless young woman who, at twenty-four, embarks on a sea voyage with a party of other English folk to South America. Guileless, and with only a smattering of education, Rachel is taken under the wing of her aunt Helen, who desires to teach Rachel "how to live."Arriving in Santa Marina, a village on the South American coast, Rachel and Helen are introduced to a group of English expatriates. Among them is the young, sensitive Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer, with whom Rachel falls in love. But theirs is ultimately a tale of doomed love, set against a chorus of other stories and other points of view, as the narrative shifts focus between its central and peripheral characters. E. M. Forster praised The Voyage Out as "a book which attains unity as surely as "Wuthering Heights, though by a different path." <br>This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Cunningham, bestselling author of "The Hours. Cunningham at once unfolds an engaging shortessay of Woolf's early life and career, an insightful exploration of the themes to which Woolf returns again and again in her fiction, and a spirited defense of the relevance and lasting importance of her art. Katherine Anne Porter wrote of Woolf: "The world of arts was her native territory; she ranged freely under her own sky, speaking her mother tongue fearlessly."The Voyage Out (1915) is the story of a rite of passage. When Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father&#39;s ship she is launched on a course of self-discovery in a modern version of the mythic voyage. Virginia Woolf knew all too well the forms that she was supposed to follow when writing of a young lady&#39;s entrance into the world, and she struggled to subvert the conventions, wittily and assiduously, rewriting and revising the novel many times. The finished work is not, on the face of it, a &#39;portrait of the artist&#39;. However, through The Voyage Out readers discover Woolf as an emerging and original artist: not identified with the heroine, but present everywhere in the social satire, the lyricism, and the patterning of consciousness.</p><h2>Heart of Texas, Vol. 1: Lonesome Cowboy / Texas Two-Step</h2><p><b><i>Lonesome Cowboy</i></b><br>Savannah Weston lives quietly on the family ranch with her<br>brother, Grady.

He'd told Savannah that the ghost town was dangerous, that it was a disturbing place. He'd told her over and over not to look for it. And all these years Savannah<i> had</i> stayed away. But the more her brother cautioned her, the more convinced she'd become that she had to find it. If for no other reason than the roses. Roses were Savannah's passion"especially old roses, planted before 1867 and now found mostly in cemeteries and abandoned homesteads.</p> <p>It was because of the roses that she ignored Grady's advice and began to seek out the long-lost town.</p> <p>After a six-week search, roaming about the rugged Texas hill country, first in the truck, then on horseback and finally on foot with no map and little information, she'd located it. Bitter End. What a strange name, but no stranger than the town itself.</p> <p>No matter how furious Grady was when he discovered what she'd done, it'd been worth the risk. This certainly wouldn't be the first time she'd defied her older brother. Nor would it be the last. Grady seemed to carry the weight of the world on</p> <p>his shoulders; he rarely smiled anymore. He was as loud and demanding as Savannah was quiet and intense. But her stubbornness was easily a match for his.</p> <p>Glancing at the truck's speedometer, she pressed her foot to the floor, although it generally wasn't in her nature to rush. However, her chances of escaping Grady's anger were greater if she got back to the house before he returned from his duties around the ranch. Not that she <i>feared</i> his anger; she simply preferred to avoid it.</p> <p>Her brother was so often angry these days, with beef prices dropping and all the other problems associated with running a large cattle ranch. It didn't help that, thanks to Richard, they continued to struggle with debt and financial hardship.</p> <p>Savannah forced her thoughts away from the unhappy events of six years earlier. It was wrenching enough to have lost both parents in one devastating accident, but Savannah feared that their brother's betrayal, which had followed so soon afterward, would forever taint their lives with bitterness.</p> <p>"Oh, Richard," she whispered as the truck sped down the winding country road. The pain he'd wrought in her life and Grady's was the kind that even love would never completely heal.</p> <p>Grady had changed in the years since their parents' tragic deaths"and Richard's betrayal. Finances and other concerns had harassed and tormented him until she barely knew him any longer. Through sheer stubbornness and backbreaking work he'd managed to accomplish the impossible. He's saved the Yellow Rose Ranch, but at a terrible price. Grady had sacrificed himself and his youth to hold on to the land that had been settled by their great-great-grandfather shortly after the Civil War. Or, as her Southern grandmother called it, the War of the Northern Aggression.</p> <p>Savannah had wanted to help with their finances; after all, she had a college education. It would be a small thing to return to school and take the necessary courses to obtain her teaching certificate. The Promise school board had repeatedly advertised for substitute teachers, and a full-time position was bound to become available within a few years. Grady, however, wouldn't hear of it. He needed her on the Yellow Rose, and Savannah accepted that. She handled the majority of the paperwork, cooked, cleaned the house and did the gardening. She'd indulged her love for roses, started keeping goats and occasionally hand-raised orphaned or abandoned calves. For six years she'd picked up the slack and made a decent life for herself. But compared to Grady, she didn't feel she was doing nearly enough.</p> <p>Her desire to contribute to the family income had prompted her to establish a mail-order business for her roses, and while Grady had politely listened to her plans, he hadn't encouraged them. Her small venture was just now starting to show a profit, of which Savannah was extremely proud. In the past few months she'd been spending her evenings working on a catalog.</p> <p>What Grady needed, in Savannah's opinion, was to marry and start a family. At thirty-five he was well past the age most men settled into family life. He probably would've done so long before now if he hadn't been required to dedicate every waking minute to the ranch. She wondered whether it was too late, whether he'd ever get married. Savannah herself had long since given up any hope of marriage and children. Her maternal urges would have to be satisfied by her animals, she told herself wryly. She'd turned thirty-one her last birthday and hadn't dated in the past four or five years. She rarely thought about having a relationship anymore. Men didn't understand her quiet ways or appreciate her strength or gentleness of spirit. It no longer mattered. She was content with her life. She'd learned to take pleasure in small things"the beauty of flowers, the affection of animals, the comfort of a well-ordered house.</p> <p>Indian paintbrush, bluebonnets and pink evening primroses, all in bloom, lined the twisting road. Savannah loved spring. The scent of the air brought with it the promise of warm weather and new life. Grady and Wiley, the hired hand who'd been with them so many years he was more family than foreman, had assisted in delivering fourteen calves this week and were looking for that many more in the next couple of days.</p> <p>Savannah glanced at her watch and hoped Grady had been delayed this afternoon. Otherwise he was going to have a conniption, especially when he realized where she'd gone.</p> <p>Sighing, she turned the familiar bend in the road and caught sight of an abandoned truck parked close to the ditch. Savannah didn't recognize the vehicle; that in itself was unusual. People who didn't know the area hardly ever wandered this far off the beaten path.</p> <p>The truck had seen better days. The color had faded badly and a large dent in the side revealed a section where rust had eaten a hole the size of a small plate. With the truck parked as it was, fifteen miles outside of town, far from anywhere, Savannah couldn't help wondering if something was wrong. She might have stopped to investigate if she hadn't been in a hurry.</p> <p>The decision was taken from her a few miles down the road when she saw a cowboy walking, carrying a saddle. Even from this distance she could see how weary he was; he seemed to be favoring one side, limping discernibly. At the sound of her approach, he straightened, shifted the weight of his saddle and stuck out his thumb.</p> <p>Never in all her life had Savannah stopped for a hitchhiker, but this man, miles from anywhere and walking in the opposite direction from town, must have been spent.</p> <p>Savannah pulled over and eased to a stop. She opened the door and climbed out. "Is that your truck parked back there?"</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," he answered politely. He was tall and wiry, about her age, she guessed. His Stetson rested low on his brow, shading his face from the afternoon sun. When he touched his fingers to the brim in greeting, she noticed that his eyes were pale blue. "I'd be much obliged for a ride."</p> <p>Although she'd stopped, Savannah hesitated, unsure what to do. "I wasn't headed toward town."</p> <p>"As far as you'd take me would be appreciated. Your truck's the first vehicle to come along in more'n two hours." He gave her a tired smile. "I'd hoped to find a ranch and use the phone there, but I haven't seen one yet."</p> <p>Apparently he didn't realized he was walking away from Promise. "I live ten or so miles down the road." Shielding her eyes from the glare of the sun, she pointed toward the Yellow Rose. Riding with her would only take him farther from where he needed to go. She was about to explain as much, then realized he was tired, hurting and probably hadn't eaten a decent meal in hours, if not days. Grady wouldn't be pleased, but&#x2014; She shrugged off the prospect of her brother's wrath.</p> <p>"If you like, you can stay the night in the bunkhouse and I'll drive you to town in the morning."</p> <p>She could tell that her offer surprised him; his eyes widened briefly. "That's mighty kind of you, ma'am."</p> <p>The fact that he called her ma'am made her feel dowdy and old-fashioned. She supposed that was exactly what she was, though. No one had to tell her she looked older than her age. She usually wore full-length dresses rather than the more fashionable shirt and jeans; her mother had encouraged this, saying that dresses complimented her tall willowy figure. She'd grown accustomed to working in them, donning an apron for household chores. Her thick straight blond hair fell down her back, almost to her waist. Grady had teasingly called her a flower child of the sixties, and in some ways, she did resemble a hippie.</p> <p>"I'm Savannah Weston."</p> <p>"Laredo Smith." Again he touched the brim of his hat.</p> <p>"Pleased to meet you," she said and smiled shyly. "Laredo's an unusual name."</p> <p>He grinned as if the comment was familiar. "So I've heard." He hitched the saddle higher and added, "My given name's Matthew, but when I was a kid and we moved away from Texas, I wanted to take part of it with me. From that day on I only answered to Laredo. After all these years, I don't know who Matthew is, but Laredo&#x2014;well, it's a comfortable fit and suits me just fine." </p><p>Savannah couldn't have said why, but she had the impression that these details weren't something he shared often. She told herself it was silly to feel honored"but she did, anyway.</p> <p>She must have smiled because he responded with a grin of his own. It amazed her how a simple smile could transform his drained features. A hint of something warm and kind showed in his sun-weathered face, mesmerizing her for a moment. A little shocked by her own response, Savannah decided she was being fanciful and looked away. Laredo Smith was a stranger and she'd do well to take care.</p> <p>"If you'd like, you can put your saddle in the truck bed," she offered and walked to the back to lower the tailgate.</p> <p>The leather creaked as he lifted it from his shoulder and wearily set it down. He hesitated when he saw the roses and reached out a callused hand toward the fragile buds. Gently he fingered a delicate pink petal.</p> <p>"These are antique roses, aren't they?" He closed his eyes and breathed in the distinctive perfumed scent of the flowers.</p> <p>His knowledge surprised her. Few people knew about old roses or had heard the term. In her research Savannah had learned that many of the roses found in Texas were of unknown lineage, recovered from hidden corners and byways in an ongoing search-and-rescue mission"like the one she'd been on that very day. Savannah was well aware that some would describe her as a "rose rustler"; it wasn't how she thought of herself. Her overwhelming motivation was her love of the flowers.</p> <p>"You know about old roses?" she asked.</p> <p>"My grandmother had a rose garden and she grew roses passed down by her own grandmother. It must be at least twenty years since I saw one. Where'd you ever find these?"</p> <p>Her pause was long enough for him to notice. "In an old graveyard," she said. "Near, um, an abandoned town." While it was the truth, it wasn't the <i>entire</i> truth, but Savannah didn't dare add any details about the ghost town. Only a few people in Promise had even heard of Bitter End. And although Grady had repeatedly warned her against seeking it out, he'd never told her exactly what was so threatening about the long-deserted town.</p> <p>Only now did Savannah understand her brother's concerns. The dangers weren't found in the crumbling buildings or the abandoned wells; no, they weren't so easily explained. She couldn't help shuddering as she remembered the sensation of&#x2014;darkness that had come over her when she'd first set foot on the still, silent grounds. Even that didn't adequately describe the emotions she'd experienced. It wasn't a feeling of evil so much as a pressing sadness, a pain and grief so raw that a hundred years hadn't dimmed its intensity.</p> <p>Knowing little of the town's history, Savannah had felt defenseless and almost afraid. Years earlier, Grady and two of his friends had heard their parents discussing Bitter End, but when Savannah questioned her mother, she'd refused to talk about it. From Grady, Savannah had learned that the town was said to have been settled by Promise's founding fathers. Why they'd moved, what had happened to prompt the relocation, was an unsolved mystery. For all she knew, it was something as mundane as water rights. Although that would hardly account for what she'd felt".</p> <p>Despite Grady's warnings, Savannah had found Bitter End and dug up the old roses in the graveyard, but she hadn't ventured beyond the fenced area beside the church. She left as quickly as she could. By the time she made it back to the truck, she was pale and trembling.</p> <p>She'd driven away without looking back. She hadn't investigated any of the other buildings, and she was annoyed now for letting the opportunity pass. She might have found more old roses had she taken the time to search.</p> <p>"They're beautiful," Laredo said. The light pink bud, perfectly formed, lay like a jewel in the palm of his hand.</p> <p>"They truly are exquisite, aren't they?" The sheer joy and excitement she'd felt on discovering the roses quickened her voice. "I just couldn't be happier! It's so much more than I hoped to find!"</p> <p>His gaze held hers and he nodded, seeming to share her enthusiasm.</p> <p>Warming to her subject, Savannah added, "It's incredible to think they've survived all these years without anyone to care for them."</p> <p>Laredo gently withdrew his hand from the rosebud. "Would you be more comfortable if I rode in the back, ma'am?" he asked.</p> <p>"Savannah," she insisted.</p> <p>The smile returned again, briefly. "Savannah," he echoed.</p> <p>"You're welcome to ride in front with me."</p> <p>He climbed slowly into the cab and she could see that the action pained him considerably.</p> <p>"I don't suppose you know anyone who's looking for a good wrangler?" he asked.</p></p><h2>Running Scared (Rarities Unlimited, 2)</h2><p><p>In the scorching heat of the Southwestern desert, a frightened old man knows his time is quickly running out . . . as the lethal secret he protects can be hidden no longer.</p><p>Risa Sheridan knows everything about gold&#x2014;its mysteries, its allure, its perils.

"If you only read one book about the First World War in this anniversary year, read <em>The Long Shadow</em>. David Reynolds writes superbly and his analysis is compelling and original." &#x2015;Anne Chisolm, Chair of the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize Committee, and Chair of the Royal Society of Literature.</strong></p> One of the most violent conflicts in the history of civilization, World War I has been strangely forgotten in American culture. It has become a ghostly war fought in a haze of memory, often seen merely as a distant preamble to World War II. In <em>The Long Shadow</em> critically acclaimed historian David Reynolds seeks to broaden our vision by assessing the impact of the Great War across the twentieth century. He shows how events in that turbulent century&#x2015;particularly World War II, the Cold War, and the collapse of Communism&#x2015;shaped and reshaped attitudes to 1914&#x2013;18. <p>By exploring big themes such as democracy and empire, nationalism and capitalism, as well as art and poetry, <em>The Long Shadow</em> is stunningly broad in its historical perspective. Reynolds throws light on the vast expanse of the last century and explains why 1914&#x2013;18 is a conflict that America is still struggling to comprehend. Forging connections between people, places, and ideas, The Long Shadow ventures across the traditional subcultures of historical scholarship to offer a rich and layered examination not only of politics, diplomacy, and security but also of economics, art, and literature. The result is a magisterial reinterpretation of the place of the Great War in modern history.</p> 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>David Reynolds is a professor of international history at Cambridge University.

Even Cutter, the Foxworth dog with a nose for trouble, has his back when trouble explodes!</p><p>Justine Davis lives on Puget Sound in Washington State, watching big ships and the occasional submarine go by, and sharing the neighborhood with assorted wildlife, including a pair of bald eagles, deer, a bear or two, and a tailless raccoon. In the few hours when she's not planning, plotting, or writing her next book, her favorite things are photography, knitting her way through a huge yarn stash, and driving her restored 1967 Corvette roadster&#x2014;top down, of course.Amy Clark slipped her glasses back on as she reached the baggage claim carousel. It was cool and rainy here in Seattle in mid-April, but LA had been having an early heat wave so she welcomed the change. She welcomed even more being away from everything else she'd left behind. Already the burden of her problem felt lighter.<br><br>Even after years away, this misty green place still felt like home.<br><br>It felt safe.<br><br><i>With your luck, you 'll end up back here soon, running home because the big, bad city was too ugly, too nasty for you.</i><br><br>She wasn't ready to admit that it was both those things yet. She'd worked hard and loved her job as a paralegal. She wasn't ready to give up on the dream. Even if it seemed on the edge of turning into a nightmare.<br><br>Which reminded her, she was going to have to get her car fixed when she got home. How stupid to have scraped it up like that trying to escape that van that hadn't really been following her anyway. It just happened to be going the same direction, hundreds of people headed for the airport and the surrounding area every day. She was just on edge, her imagination in overdrive. She&#x2014;<br><br>"Hey, stranger!"<br><br>She whirled, a huge grin spreading across her face as she saw her best friend. Hayley Cole&#x2014;Foxworth, she corrected, still not quite used to the change&#x2014;looked as she always did, vibrant, her green eyes sparkling. Their hug was worthy of two people who had been friends since the second grade.<br><br>The baggage carousel came alive, began to move. Hay-ley looked at it warily.<br><br>"I'm getting better," Amy said with a laugh. "A whole three-day weekend with only one bag and a carry-on."<br><br>"And a purse the size of Alaska," Hayley retorted.<br><br>"Well, yes. Because you never know."<br><br>"It's not really leaving home if you bring most of home with you," Hayley said, right on cue. They both laughed at the old, familiar exchange.<br><br>Amy spotted her suitcase and grabbed it as it circled past. It was heavy, but not impossible, and they were soon headed to the parking structure. She was glad she'd put on her jacket, but still welcomed the chill in the air.<br><br>"Hot in LA, huh?" Hayley asked.<br><br>"In more ways than one," Amy said, a bit of the grimness she'd pushed aside creeping back into her voice. But she didn't want to go into it now, so she diverted. "Are the daffs up?"<br><br>"All over," Hayley answered. "Mr. Elkhart planted some new ones last fall, some interesting colors."<br><br>"I'm a traditionalist&#x2014;I love the yellow ones." A bouquet of daffodils was one of the most cheerful sights she could imagine.<br><br>"I know, you always did. We can..."<br><br>Hayley broke off, laughing. They'd reached her car, and a second later Amy was laughing, too. For sitting in the driver's seat, looking at them with a pleased expression, was Hayley's dog, Cutter.<br><br>"I left him in the back," Hayley said.<br><br>"Is he going to drive?" she asked with a grin.<br><br>"Wouldn't surprise me. At all."<br><br>Amy laughed at Hayley's serious tone as her friend hit the unlock button and the compact SUV chirped obligingly. She opened the driver's door. Cutter jumped out at their feet. He was as beautiful as Amy remembered with his black head and shoulders and russet-brown body. He greeted Hayley with a swipe of pink tongue. To Amy's surprise, she herself got a more effusive greeting, a plumy tail-wagging, nudging sort of dance that made her smile. She set down her voluminous purse to greet him properly.<br><br>"Well, hello again, Cutter."<br><br>He gave a short yip, and she bent to pet him. The moment she stroked his dark head she felt an odd sensation of relief, as if suddenly she knew it would all work out, it would all be all right. All the fears seemed to not vanish but at least recede.<br><br>In that instant, the welcoming dance stopped. The dog leaned into her, staring up into her face. Something in the intense gaze, or in those gold-flecked dark eyes, was mesmerizing, and she couldn't seem to look away.<br><br>And then he moved. He turned, sat down at Amy's feet and looked up at Hayley. And Hayley, oddly, stopped mid-motion as she was putting her own purse in the car. Her eyes flicked from the dog to Amy.<br><br>"Uh-oh," Hayley said.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Are you all right?"<br><br>Amy hadn't expected that. At least, not so soon. "Fine," she said. And health-wise, it was true. Otherwise, not so much. But she needed to work up to discussing that. "I may need your help loading this up, though," she said, gesturing at the large blue suitcase.<br><br>"Hmm." Hayley sounded doubtful, but she seemed to accept the answer. She looked back at the dog. "I got it, boy. I promise."<br><br>Cutter gave a low, soft whuff and a movement of his head that looked startlingly like a nod. Amy had no idea what was going on. She'd never had a dog, so she was a neophyte.<br><br>Within a few minutes they were out of the airport and onto the freeway. Amy knew it would be only natural for Hayley to ask how things were going at work and she wasn't ready for that, so she turned it around.<br><br>"How are things at the Foxworth Foundation?"<br><br>"Quiet," Hayley said. Then she glanced toward the back of the SUV where Cutter was now settled in quietly. "At least, they have been. It's been nice to have a break."<br><br>"Especially since your last case was so huge. Talk about taking on the big guys!" Amy knew the Foxworth Foundation had only one goal, to help those in the right who couldn't fight alone any longer. The size of the case didn't matter, but sometimes it got both large and complicated.<br><br>Hayley laughed. "Hey, we weren't even here. That was Cutter and Brett Dunbar, with a little help from Rafe. And things are already getting fixed."<br><br>Amy studied her friend for a moment. Hayley had been through some rough times&#x2014;the death of her father when she was twelve, more recently the long, slow battle with her mother's terminal cancer. And of course there was Walker, that black-sheep miscreant. Hayley was far too generous when it came to her thoughtless, selfish, cold-hearted brother. All she ever said about the guy who had walked out after their family tragedy, who had later left her alone to deal with their mother, was that everyone had to handle grief in their own way.<br><br>She supposed she might be inclined to a little more generosity herself if she hadn't had such a crush on him when she was a kid, Amy thought. She'd adored Walker Cole, and although she was just his little sister's friend, he'd always been kind. And then he'd shattered all her illusions. She tried not to remember her foolishness.<br><br>"You're sure Quinn won't mind me being here? I mean, you have only been married three months."<br><br>Hayley laughed. "He's glad you could come. He even said it was too bad you couldn't stay for the month."<br><br>"I couldn't, anyway. I have our big office anniversary party in a couple of weeks," she said, "but remind me to thank him for that."<br><br>"He knows what you mean to me," Hayley said quietly. "He knows you were there for me every time life kicked me in the teeth. You never let me down."<br><br><i>Unlike your idiot brother, who left you alone to deal.</i><br><br>She stopped herself before she could go down that path. Thinking of Walker Cole was not going to help matters. Because then she would start thinking about how nice he'd once been to her, how he tolerated her silly crush, which would make her think of how just spotting him had sent her heart racing, how she'd learned everything she could about baseball because he played it. Then she'd graduate to his crooked grin, thick, unruly hair and those amazing hazel eyes that were a golden green rimmed with a darker shade, so different from his sister's meadow green. She knew it was a trick of melanin and light scattering, had even looked it up once, but that didn't detract from the beauty of them.<br><br>And here she was, thinking about him.<br><br>She shook off the odd mood, determined to enjoy this visit as much as she could, despite the reason for it. And despite her fear that her life was going to blow up.<br><br>"What are you frowning about?"<br><br>"Was I?"<br><br>"Yes. Let me guess, you're still mad at Walker?" That was the problem with best friends; they saw things others might miss.<br><br>"After what he did? Of course I am. On top of everything else, missing your wedding without even a word except that stupid text message?"<br><br>For the first time a hint of disappointment showed on Hayley's face. "Yes. He did. And I'm not sure Quinn will forgive him for that very soon."<br><br>"I think I'd like to see the day they finally meet, if they ever do," Amy said, thinking with a rather grim satisfaction of the powerful&#x2014;and intimidating&#x2014;Quinn Foxworth taking Walker Cole apart piece by piece.<br><br>"You wouldn't hate him so much if you hadn't loved him first," Hayley said.<br><br>"Schoolgirl infatuation," Amy said, even as she realized ruefully how close her friend's words were to her own earlier thought. "Believe me, I'm angry enough on your behalf alone."<br><br>This was true, but she also knew that she had loved him, with all the strength of her teenage heart. She'd loved his laugh, she'd loved the way he teasingly winked at her and she would never, ever forget the time he had come to her defense when she'd been cornered by a trio of nerd-baiting mean-girl types. He'd already been tall at seventeen, and a star athlete, and that he had bothered to step in and chase off the three&#x2014;who happened to idolize him, the star pitcher on the high school baseball team&#x2014;had thrilled her down to her thirteen-year-old soul. It had also insulated her somewhat from further attack. Word had gotten out that she was under the protection of Walker Cole, and while she was sure the nasty comments and thoughts continued, she was never backed into a corner again.<br><br>And then it had all fallen apart. His father died and a year later he was gone, the college scholarship abandoned along with his mother and his little sister. The mother and little sister Amy had always thought he loved.<br><br><i>Just goes to prove you're a lousy judge of men. If you ever needed more proof.</i><br><br>She shook her head sharply. This was not the time to dwell on her miserable dating track record. Not when she'd made a much more serious misjudgment than just dating the wrong men.<br><br>And this one could at the least upend, at the worst ruin her life forever.<br><br>At least, she hoped that was the worst.<br><br><i>Chapter 2</i><br><br>You want to tell me what's really wrong?" Hayley finally asked when they were parked in line for the big ferry that would take them across the sound. "Because Cutter says something is."<br><br>Amy blinked. "What?"<br><br>"He knows you have a problem. And," Hayley added in a dry tone, "he expects action."<br><br>"What are you talking about?"<br><br>"That look he gave me, after you petted him. That's his 'fix it' look."<br><br>Amy remembered the moment when the dog had sat at her feet and looked at Hayley. Was it possible the dog had sensed her turmoil? From what her friend had told her, the dog was incredibly empathetic.<br><br>Amy drew in a deep breath, savoring the salt-tanged air, looking out over the water toward the towering, snowcapped Olympic Mountains. She couldn't wait to get into the thick trees where the fresh scent of evergreens would add its own note to the smell of home.<br><br>"I did want to talk to you about something. I need some help working something out, and you're the only one I trust."<br><br>Hayley smiled. "We always do work it out, eventually."<br><br>"Yes. Not," she added hastily, "that that's the only reason I came."<br><br>"I'm glad to see you whatever the reason," Hayley said. "So what's the problem?"<br><br>"I... It's complicated."<br><br>"I assumed so or we could have talked it out on the phone."<br><br>"No, no, I couldn't talk about it on the phone."<br><br>Something about Hayley's demeanor changed then, and the next sideways glance she gave her was different, more intent, more alert.<br><br>"Amy, are you in trouble? Did something happen?"<br><br>"No and yes. Or yes and yes, maybe. I didn't do anything wrong," she hastened to assure her friend.<br><br>"I never thought you had. Or would. Is it a personal thing? Some guy?"<br><br>Amy laughed sourly at that. "Please. My love life is as dry as LA these days. Only available men I meet are lawyers, and I've found I don't care for most of them much. Not that it matters&#x2014;I'm not their type, either."<br><br>"Not shallow and flashy enough?" Hayley suggested.<br><br>For the first time since she'd started this journey, Amy laughed with genuine pleasure. "And that is why I run to you, my friend. I would have said too quiet and serious. LA legal affairs is a high-powered world."<br><br>"Their loss," Hayley said dismissively. "So, what kind of help do you need? More than just talking it out?"<br><br>"I.don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out."<br><br>"One question, then."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Should we head for the house, or should I have Quinn meet us at Foxworth?"<br><br>Amy hadn't expected that to come up so soon. Hayley seemed ready to spring into some sort of action, just like that. Maybe working with Foxworth had brought that on.<br><br>"House," she said. "It's not...immediate."<br><br>She put it out of her mind for the pleasant duration of the ferry ride. They took a walk around the upper deck, outside, so Amy could take it all in again. She looked back as they crossed, seeing the dock and the buildings shrink as the ones they were heading for slowly grew and she began to be able to pick out familiar buildings amid the tall, thick trees. She looked toward the cliffs of the south end of Whidby Island to the north, always a favorite spot of hers since the day she'd seen a pod of orcas passing through the strait.<br><br>To complete her ritual, she hit the snack bar for a cup of her beloved clam chowder. Her glasses fogged up as she held the steaming cup under her nose, and they both laughed.<br><br>"I like those," Hayley said, indicating the red frames.<br><br>"So do I," Amy said. The various pairs of glasses she had were her one indulgence; since she had to wear them, she wanted options. What had been a painful necessity as a child had become almost a signature style for her now. She even thought she looked odd without them.</p><h2>The Four Winds of Heaven</h2><p>The world in which David and Mathilde de Gunzburg, Russia&#39;s foremost Jewish family, raise their children--Anna, Ossip, Sonia, and Gino--shatters as the Romanov dynasty falls and their children are touched by passion and the tides of change</p><p></p><h2>Dragon Ball ( Volume 1 of 16) (Japanese Edition)</h2><p>Songoku has a superhuman power living in a mountain.

Curled up, thumb in mouth. Four, maybe five years old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned round. The last few passengers were shuffling away from me down the aisle to the doors. "Whose is this child?" I called.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody looked back. Perhaps the bombing had deafened them. Or maybe they simply didn't want to hear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Please. Someone's left a child!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But they were gone, making their way down the steps and joining the line of people straggling toward the village hall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was lucky I was there, checking every bus. Otherwise this small girl might have gone all the way back to Southampton. Everybody knew the city was still on fire. We'd seen the smoke from Beacon Hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She hadn�t stirred in spite of my calling. She lay senseless, a gossamer net of light brown hair clinging to her forehead. Her puff-sleeved dress was a dusty mid-blue, the color of the endpapers in the board books of my childhood. No coat or cardigan, despite it being the first day of December. Just a grimy white blanket tangled round her legs, the kind mothers wrapped their babies in, a special knit honeycombed with little holes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook her small round shoulder. "Wake up, little one. Wake up."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her thumb fell out of her mouth, but she didn't open her eyes. I stroked back her hair. Her skin was warm and slightly damp. Her tongue was ticking against the roof of her mouth. Thumb or no thumb, she was still sucking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose she started crying when I woke her? I had no great experience with tearful children. Perhaps I should simply carry her into the village hall, and never mind if she was asleep. I took off my new brooch, a silver bar with a pearl, and put it in my pocket. I didn't want it to scrape the child's face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I slid my hands against her hot sides, into her hotter armpits, and pulled her toward me. She was amazingly solid, made of denser stuff than the rest of the world. I got one arm round her back and the other under her bottom, and hoisted her up. Her head rocked back as far as it could go, forward again to bump against my collarbone. Then her whole body gave a series of jerks, as if a faulty electrical current was running through her. Perhaps she'd been hit on the head during the air raid. I should get her to the doctor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dirty blanket fell down over my feet and I kicked it away and walked with a strange swinging tread down the aisle of the bus. You had to walk this way, I realized, with a child in your arms. There was a powerful odor of Jeyes Fluid in the bus but she smelled warm, salty, of new-baked bread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deirdre Harper came out of the village hall, forearms red to the elbow and dripping suds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Deirdre, is anyone missing a girl?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She wiped her hands on her apron and delved in the pocket to produce a single wrinkled cigarette. "You're having me on, Mrs. Parr. Now I've seen it all. They can't even remember their own kiddies."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sure it's not like that. Everyone's in shock . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deirdre lit up and exhaled smoke with a wide, down-curving smile of contempt. "In a funk, more like. Funk is all this is, you know. Look at them, scarpering on the buses instead of staying put in their shelters."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't point out that not everyone in Southampton had shelters. Deirdre had lost her son at the beginning of the war, in the sea off the coast of Norway; she no longer cared what she said, and nobody took her to task.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They've got tea, anyway," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, the stockpile we were saving for the Christmas Carols." She regarded the child sourly. "Your Mr. Parr will find that mother of hers. Trained for this, isn't he. Billeting officer and all."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes. I should go in, Deirdre."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just then she sighed, and suddenly her eyes filled. "Christ, poor bloody Southampton. Fifteen mile away, and such a glow off the clouds last night, it damn near lit me home."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I made my way into the village hall, carrying the child through the crowd of bedraggled, bewildered, noisy people, edging past overturned chairs and youngsters sliding through puddles of spilled tea. "Whose is this little girl?" I called out. "Has anyone seen her mother?" Nobody replied. I pushed onward past a squirming terrier, a camp of sleeping babies wedged among baskets and coats, a gang of disheveled old men making free with a hip flask. "Is anyone looking for this child?" I called, louder this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where are we, doll?" said one of the old men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Upton," I told him. "The village of Upton. Do you know this little girl?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shook his head. An odd smell was coming off his coat, a reek of something burned. I moved away but the smell remained in my nostrils. I glanced up at the high windows of the hall and saw that the light was fading fast. We didn't have long until blackout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Halfway down the hall I found Mrs. Daventry and Miss Legg. Two pillars of our little community, they were standing by a table and picking hopelessly at the knot on a bale of blankets. I hitched my burden higher with one hand-astonishingly, she had not stirred-and with the other I grasped one loop of the knotted rope and pried it loose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellen has such strong fingers," Mrs. Daventry said to Miss Legg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She's so practical," Miss Legg said to Mrs. Daventry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I simply know where to pull," I told them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They looked at me silently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Have you seen a woman-" I began, but just then the wind rattled the tin roof. A small boy in the corner screamed, cowering like a hen when the hawk goes over. Other children joined him, and then everyone broke out into wordless wails and cries of fright. "I must find Mr. Parr," I told the ladies, and made my way toward the back of the hall. I could hear Selwyn speaking, his true tenor that carried through the hubbub. Such a good singer my husband was, a merry singer. I followed his voice until the crowd parted at last to reveal him bending over a middle-aged couple huddled on their chairs. "Are you hurt?" he was asking them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Selwyn!" I felt breathless, as if I had run a long way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellen, darling." He straightened up with a smile. "Where are you taking this young person?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I twisted my neck away from the child's hot face. "She was asleep in the back of the bus, all alone. I can't find her mother."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes widened. "She was left on the bus?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes." I stared around the room. "Selwyn, what are we going to do with all these people? Another busload and we'll run out of tea, and then it'll be pandemonium. And what about the blackout?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It will not be pandemonium." He chuckled. "The Scouts are coming to put up the blackout curtains. And we've got blankets for the men. The women and children we'll take into the village. Colonel Daventry's bringing his cart." He scratched his head, disordering his fine sandy hair. "They'll be on the floors, but it's the best we can do. I can't find an empty bed in Upton."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I smelled something awful," I said. "Something charred. I don't know what it was." To my dismay, tears started to sting my eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come now, sweetheart." Selwyn squeezed my arm. "Chin up. Try that lady over there on the camp bed. She's completely collapsed." He pointed with his pen. "I heard her saying, 'Daphne, Daphne.'"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stared up at him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This child may be she." His voice was patient. "Daphne."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The woman lay rigid, her eyes flicking like a metronome from side to side. �Daphne,� she declared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I kneeled down beside her, cradling the child on my lap to let the woman see her face. "Madam, is this Daphne? Is this your daughter?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her eyes flicked to and fro. They seemed to glance at the girl. "Daphne."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That ain't Daphne," said a voice behind me. "Daphne's her Siamese cat. This lady's Mrs. Irene Cartledge and she was right as rain when we got off the bus. We're waiting for your doctor to come and have a look at her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to the speaker. She was sitting on the floor like me, her huge, pallid bare knees pressed together, one of her eyes half-closed under a swelling purple bruise. "I'm Mrs. Berrow, Phyl Berrow."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My name's Ellen Parr. Do you need a compress for that poor eye, Mrs. Berrow? I'm sure we can rustle something up."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, dear. Shock or what, it don't hurt. Parr," she repeated. "Your dad's got a hell of a job to billet us all."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I managed to smile. "Mr. Parr's my husband." I thought of my pearl brooch, and felt a little swell of pride. "It's our first wedding anniversary today."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, lor. What a way to spend it." She looked me up and down. "Ain't he the lucky one."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Actually, Mrs. Berrow, I count myself extremely lucky."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A friendly glint came to her eye. "Right you are, dear." She shuffled closer. "Let's have a look at the kiddy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once again I smoothed back the light hair from the child's face. She was rosy, disdainful in sleep, eyebrows raised and lips turned down. The piped seam of the bus seat had made a darker pink crease in the pink of her cheek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wake her up, dear."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She won't wake. And she went very jerky earlier. I'm frightened she might have damage to her brain."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bless you." Mrs. Berrow revealed five sound teeth in a slot of black. "They all do that. Sleep through the Second Coming at this age. Give her here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She stood the child on her feet, blew into her face, and let go. My own arms leaped out but Mrs. Berrow got there first and held her fast, blew again, let go once more. The blowing ruffled the child's eyelashes and she squeezed her eyelids shut. Then she wobbled, righted herself, and sniffed in a sharp breath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Here, lovey." Mrs. Berrow grasped the small chubby arms. "Come, open those peepers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The little girl did so, suddenly, wide open and startled. Her eyes were clear hazel, almost the same color as her hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's your name, dear?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Daphne," said the woman on the camp bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Pack it in, Irene." Mrs. Berrow fixed the child with her one good eye. "Let me see. Might you be called Mavis Davis?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The child gave a slow blink. Still waking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or Sally O'Malley?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or Nancy Fancy? Help me, dearie, I'm running out of names," said Mrs. Berrow, and the little girl spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not Nancy Fancy! I'm Pamela! Where's Mummy?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her voice was clear, piping, like a twig peeled of its bark. She was well-spoken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Pamela." Mrs. Berrow patted her cheek. "Ain't that a pretty name."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where's my mummy?" Pamela spun around. "Mummy? Where's Mummy?" Her voice wavered. She pulled away from Mrs. Berrow. "I can't see Mummy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten seconds had passed, a small time but enough for her mouth to quiver and large tears to spill down her cheeks. "Pamela." I clasped her hand. "We think Mummy got off the bus and left you there by mistake, so we need to find her. What does Mummy look like?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Beautiful." She scrubbed at her face. "But she wasn't on my bus, she was on the one before."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Her ma got on a different bus?" Mrs. Berrow started to heave herself to her feet. "How the hell did she manage that?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The ladies said!" Pamela stood on tiptoes to peer into the crowd-so futile, in a person barely a yard high. "They said I should get on the bus with them and then I'd find her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I gasped. "What ladies?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The ladies," she said impatiently, as if it were obvious. "They saw me. The bus came." Her face crumpled. "They said if I got on, we'd find Mummy." Her lungs began to pump out sobs and her arms went up and down, striking her sides. I gathered her to me once again and lifted her up. She wept and thrashed in my arms as I took her over to one side of the hall, set her down on a huge unlit radiator. "What's your other name, Pamela?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Jane," she sobbed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, your family name." But she was crying too hard. I stood up straight. "Does anyone know this little girl?" I called out. "Her name's Pamela. Pamela Jane." Heads turned and shook, and I saw women gathering their children together, and a bustle in the doorway-people from the village, arriving to take them away. The tide was running out. "Pamela Jane! Did anyone travel with this child?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At last. A woman was emerging from the throng, incongruously elegant in a fur coat and maroon toque, making her way to us. "I was with this little one," she said when she arrived at my side. "I helped her on board the bus."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Didn't you hear me call earlier?" I spoke flatly out of exasperation. If she thought I was rude, she made no sign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I might have been in the lavs, dear." She pointed to another, large woman. "That lady said the little girl's mother was on the bus before ours. So we took her on the next one, with us." The large woman was already approaching, buttoning her cardigan over her bust. "Isn't that right?" asked the lady wearing the toque. "You saw her ma on the first bus?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's what the little one said." The second woman's voice was a creaky whisper. "Pardon me. Smoke's got my throat."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pamela gasped. "You said Mummy was on the other bus. But she wasn't!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, you was saying it, sweetheart," the woman croaked, her eyes full of alarm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No!" Pamela was frantic. "I just thought she was!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So I said, we'll catch up with Mummy, sweetie, and I took her on board." The large woman put her hands to her cheeks. "Now I think about it, how could any woman get on a blooming bus without her little daughter? But the little one was insistent!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I wasn't 'sistent!" Pamela continued her choleric weeping. "I saw her head but I didn't know it was her head! You said!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The elegant woman put her hand to her toque. "And we just got off the bus leaving her there." She turned to me. "I'm so sorry. We was bombed, dear. I can't find any other excuse."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now they were both crying. I heard Selwyn calling. "Ladies-ladies, please come and join this group."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You both need to leave," I said. "I'll find you if I have to."</p></p><h2>Dead Stars</h2><p><i>Dead Stars</i> is Bruce Wagner&#x2019;s (<i>I'm Losing You)</i> most lavish and remarkable translation yet of the national zeitgeist: post-privacy porn culture, a Kardashianworld of rapid-cycling, disposable narrative where reality-show triumph is the new American narcotic.<p></p><p>At age thirteen, Telma is famous as the world&#x2019;s youngest breast cancer survivor until threatened with obscurity by a four-year-old Canadian who&#x2019;s just undergone a mastectomy ...

S. Lewis' forceful and accessible doctrine on Christian belief. First heard as informal radio broadcasts and then published as three separate books -- *<i>The Case for Christianity, *Christian Behavior</i>, and *<i>Beyond Personality</i> -- <b><i>Mere Christianity</i></b> brings together what Lewis sees as the fundamental truths of his religion.<br><br> Rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations, C. S. Lewis finds a common ground on which all those who have Christian faith can stand together, proving that ''at the center of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice.''</p><p>In 1943 Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, <i>Mere Christianity</i> never flinches as it sets out a rational basis for Christianity and builds an edifice of compassionate morality atop this foundation. As Mr. Lewis clearly demonstrates, Christianity is not a religion of flitting angels and blind faith, but of free will, an innate sense of justice and the grace of God.<p>In 1941 England, when all hope was threatened by the inhumanity of war, C. S. Lewis was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. More than half a century later, these talks continue to retain their poignancy. First heard as informal radio broadcasts on the BBC, the lectures were published as three books and subsequently combined as <em>Mere Christianity</em>. C. S. Lewis proves that "at the center of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice," rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations. This twentieth century masterpiece provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p><p>With a new foreword by Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, this illustrated gift edition evokes the historic time and place of the book's creation.</p></p><h2>Leonardo da Vinci: The Complete Paintings</h2><p>An in-depth volume on the complete painted works of the renowned Renaissance master showcases each of his paintings, including the Mona Lisa, The Madonna of the Rocks, The Annunciation, and the newly restored Last Supper, complemented by an examination of the artist&#39;s intellect.</p><p>In this magnificent book, Pietro Marani, the director of the project to restore Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Last Supper</i>, presents all the artist's known paintings. The history and significance of each are analyzed at length: we read, for example, that "from a very early date, <i>Mona Lisa</i> was considered among Leonardo's most extraordinary accomplishments, one that made every other artist 'tremble and lose heart.'" Context is provided by a wealth of related paintings and sketches. The presentation is extravagant: double foldouts show frescoes in their entirety, and small areas are hugely expanded to give access to a world of sensuous detail. The intimacy of these extreme details--a tiny blue landscape glimpsed through a window, or the warm flesh of a baby's foot resting on its mother's arm--is unexpected, and one of the book's many successes. <p> Marani combines connoisseurship with the technological tools of art history, such as x-ray exploration of revisions in a painting's underdrawings. He has spent his life studying Leonardo's paintings firsthand, so closely that he can point to where the artist lightly blurred layers of paint with his fingertips to suggest the soft skin around the eyes of his portraits of women. A chapter is devoted to Marani's belief that Leonardo was profoundly influenced by ancient artworks rather than being exclusively the "modern genius" described by Romantic critics. The research is fully footnoted, with appendices including checklists of paintings and lost paintings and a collection of all known primary documents referring directly to Leonardo's life. From its enigmatic cover (the lips of the artist's exquisite portrait of Ginevra de' Benci) to its extensive bibliography, <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> comes the closest this reviewer has seen to being the ultimate art book. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p>Pietro C. Marani is one of the world&#39;s foremost scholars on Leonardo da Vinci and author of more than 130 books, essays, and articles on the artist and his period. A former vice-director of the Brera Museum in Milan, and co-director of the recent restoration of Leonardo&#39;s Last Supper, he is now a professor of art history at the Politecnico di Milano.</p><h2>The Craft of the Potter: A Practical Guide to Making Pottery</h2><p>Basic potter&#39;s wheel techniques are explained along with methods of decorating and baking.

His gran died, he was sent to a foster home, and now malicious beings are stalking him. There is one person Gran told Aidan to go to if he ever got into trouble&#x2014;a powerful sorcerer who lives at Melstone House.</p><p>But when Aidan arrives on the doorstep, he finds that the sorcerer's grandson, Andrew, has inherited the house. The good news is that Aidan can tell immediately that Andrew's brimming with magic, too&#x2014;and so is everyone else at Melstone. The bad news is that Andrew doesn't remember anything his grandfather taught him. Chaos is swiftly rising, and he has no idea how to control it. A sinister neighbor is stealing power from the land, magic is leaking between realms . . . and it's only a matter of time before the Stalkers find Aidan.</p><p>If Aidan and Andrew can harness their own magics, they may be able to help each other. But can they do it before the entire countryside comes apart at the seams?</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934&#x2012;2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers. Characterized by magic, multiple universes, witches and wizards&#x2014;and a charismatic nine-lived enchanter&#x2014;her books are filled with unlimited imagination, dazzling plots, and an effervescent sense of humor that earned her legendary status in the world of fantasy.</p>Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Professor Andrew Hope inherits Melstone House, a place he had visited as a child, from his grandfather. When he arrives at the manor, everyone seems to know something that he doesn't. He remembers that the stained glass in the kitchen window has great significance, and he soon learns that he is also steward of a "field-of-care" that magically protects the estate. Things get odd when Aidan Cain, an orphan, arrives at the door looking for Andrew's grandfather, and the professor reluctantly takes the boy in. Andrew discovers that someone or something has been encroaching on his property, and with Aidan sets out to discover what. Jones excels at creating quirky, slightly off-center characters, including the tyrannical housekeeper, Mrs. Stock; and the gardener, Mr. Stock (no relation); along with leprechaunlike Tarquin O'Connor and his daughter, Stashe, who becomes Andrew's secretary and perhaps more. A giant, Groil, eats the extraordinarily large and inedible vegetables that are left on the roof of the shed each night. This book is filled with the author's singular brand of humor, found in and not at the expense of her characters. The plot is slight, and the novel is not Jones's best, but it is still miles above most current fantasy and will be welcome not only where the author's books are popular, but also where there is an appetite for fantasy.&#x2014;<i>Tim Wadham, St. Louis County Library, MO</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

She became Lady Randolph Churchill, wife of a maverick politician and mother of the most famous British statesman of the century. Jennie Churchill was not merely the most talked about and controversial American woman in London society, she was a dynamic behind-the-scenes political force and a woman of sexual fearlessness at a time when women were not supposed to be sexually liberated. A concert pianist, magazine founder and editor, and playwright, she was also, above all, a devoted mother to Winston. In <em>American Jennie</em>, Anne Sebba draws on newly discovered personal correspondences and archives to examine the unusually powerful mutual infatuation between Jennie and her son and to relate the passionate and ultimately tragic career of the woman whom Winston described as having &#x201c;the wine of life in her veins.&#x201d;</p><p>Anne Sebba is a biographer, journalist, lecturer, and author of six books, including the best-selling Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image and Laura Ashley: A Life by Design. She lives in London.As Winston Churchill's mother and close adviser, Brooklyn-born Jennie Jerome (1854&#x2013;1921) may have rated a chapter in the history books. But steeped in scandal, the passionate, ambitious and beautiful Gilded Age heiress has been fodder for several biographies of her own, including Ralph Martin's two-volume bestseller (1969&#x2013;1971). The daughter of a maverick stock speculator, Jennie was probably pregnant with Winston when she married the duke of Marlborough's second son, Randolph. She was a tireless supporter of her husband's rising political career, and endured his sexual dalliances, mental unraveling (probably from syphilis) and eventual death. She earned a reputation as a journalist, dazzling socialite, shameless booster of Winston's political aspirations, and as a financially imprudent woman who indulged in a string of sexually charged affairs. Indeed, Jennie's younger son, Jack, may have been fathered by a handsome colonel and viscount, and her purported lovers may have included the prince of Wales. After Randolph's death, she remarried twice to men 20 years her junior, and died at 67 after a bad fall caused by her high heels. Sebba's (<i>Mother Teresa</i>) admiring biography is absorbing, authoritative and makes good use of family letters. 16 pages of photos. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I wanted all the essential information in one place, so the grain guides and cooking chart make it easy to quickly get answers. The recipes are collected from many years of cooking whole grains both at home and professionally. I hope that my love of the grains shines through. The hearty, earthy flavors of some grains are balanced with strong, exciting flavors, while other, sweeter grains play a different role in the recipes. In the baking recipes, only 100% whole grain flours are used, although beginners are advised that using part unbleached flour would be a gentle transition. I believe that once you become accustomed to the real flavors and textures of whole grain breads and baked goods, you will find fluffy white bread unsatisfying. Adding whole grains to your diet can be a delicious adventure, whether you are new to them, or a seasoned pro. Give these recipes a try, and make them your own.Chef, food writer, and cooking teacher Robin Asbell specializes in natural foods and has written articles for Vegetarian Times.<br><br>Caren Alpert is a San Francisco-based photographer.</p><h2>American Oracle: The Civil War in the Civil Rights Era</h2><p><p>Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, a century after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, Martin Luther King, Jr., declared, &#x201c;One hundred years later, the Negro still is not free.&#x201d; He delivered this speech just three years after the Virginia Civil War Commission published a guide proclaiming that &#x201c;the Centennial is no time for finding fault or placing blame or fighting the issues all over again.&#x201d;</p><p><br></p><p><br>David Blight takes his readers back to the centennial celebration to determine how Americans then made sense of the suffering, loss, and liberation that had wracked the United States a century earlier. Amid cold war politics and civil rights protest, four of America&#x2019;s most incisive writers explored the gulf between remembrance and reality. Robert Penn Warren, the southern-reared poet-novelist who recanted his support of segregation; Bruce Catton, the journalist and U.S. Navy officer who became a popular Civil War historian; Edmund Wilson, the century&#x2019;s preeminent literary critic; and James Baldwin, the searing African-American essayist and activist&#x2014;each exposed America&#x2019;s triumphalist memory of the war. And each, in his own way, demanded a reckoning with the tragic consequences it spawned.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Blight illuminates not only mid-twentieth-century America&#x2019;s sense of itself but also the dynamic, ever-changing nature of Civil War memory. On the eve of the 150th anniversary of the war, we have an invaluable perspective on how this conflict continues to shape the country&#x2019;s political debates, national identity, and sense of purpose.</p></p><p>David W. Blight is Class of 1954 Professor of History at Yale University.The ghosts of the Civil War never leave us, as David Blight knows perhaps better than anyone, and in this superb book he masterfully unites two distant but inextricably bound events with insightful dissection of the works of four of our best writers, writers obsessed with coming to terms with our original sin. (Ken Burns)<br><br>Truly a tour de force... intellectual history and criticism at the highest level, told with passion and artistry. (Fitzhugh Brundage, author of <i>The Southern Past</i>)<br><br>Perceptive, eloquent, and timely, Blight's book should find a wide and appreciative audience. (Gary Gallagher, author of <i>The Union War</i>)<br><br>Blight's elegant narrative enables us to see the full, enduring, significance of the Civil War in the consciousness of four major writers. An outstanding achievement. (Caryl Phillips, author of <i>Dancing in the Dark</i>)<br><br>The Civil War has given us not only great history, literature, and art, but also great works of thought. David Blight enriches this canon by probing the war's power to haunt and inspire every generation. <i>American Oracle</i> is intellectual history at its best&#x2014;deep terrain, mined by a scholar who brings gems to the page. (Tony Horwitz, author of <i>Confederates in the Attic</i>)<br><br>During the middle decades of the twentieth century the United States faced a dual challenge&#x2014;of civility and memory, each one race-related. David Blight develops deep biographical links to connect and explain those troubled years, and does so with eloquence. He thereby adds a brilliant new aspect to the field of American memory studies. (Michael Kammen, Newton C. Farr Professor of American History and Culture (Emeritus) at Cornell University and Past President of the Organization of American Historians)<br><br>This is a distinctive addition to the books about the Civil War and how we view it on the conflict's 150th anniversary. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2011-06-27)<br><br>As the sesquicentennial of the Civil War (2011&#x2013;15) begins, historian Blight examines how we handled the centennial, which occurred at the infancy of the civil rights movement, and the persistent questioning about all the elements that were at the heart of the nation-rending civil conflict. History and great literature blend beautifully as Blight conducts his examination of the works of four writers--Robert Penn Warren, southern-born novelist; Bruce Catton, historian and journalist; Edmund Wilson, literary critic; and James Baldwin, northern-born essayist and race critic--providing background and context for their works and their views of the centennial and all its commercialism and hypocrisy. From their different perspectives, the four offer "a way of understanding the Civil War both as something very American and as an event in a larger human drama." Blight explores Warren's straightforward look at the racism at the heart of the war and the continued hypocrisy of southern commemorations, Catton's cold-eyed examination of the cost of war, Wilson's deconstruction of the war as a unifier of the nation, and Baldwin's chastisement of American racism. Throughout, Blight explores the mythology that came out of the Civil War and the sense of American redemption that did not include any examination of the tragedies of racism and slavery. (Vanessa Bush <i>Booklist (starred review)</i> 2011-09-15)<br><br>David W. Blight's richly interpretive <i>American Oracle</i> contextualizes the sentimentalized celebration of the Civil War in the early 1960s within the tense realities of the civil rights era and the Cold War. Blight unravels the complexities of Civil War memory and meaning at a time when most white Americans considered restoration of the Union, not emancipation, as the war's grand result. (John David Smith <i>Charlotte Observer</i> 2011-09-25)<br><br>This book is several things, suggests Blight, but he hits it best when he characterizes it as a "discussion of four Americans in search of their country's history." In doing so, he gives us more than a history lesson: he presents an introspective journey into America's most complex and enigmatic historical event through the minds of four exceptional storytellers. He offers us the opportunity to revisit a monumental tragedy and thereby invites us to probe its meaning. If we do, we will not only be reacquainted with a defining American moment but we will also learn more about who America is, and why. (James T. Crouse <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2011-11-10)</p><h2>Overseas</h2><p>A passionate, sweeping novel of a love that transcends time.When twenty-something Wall Street analyst Kate Wilson attracts the notice of the legendary Julian Laurence at a business meeting, no one&#x2019;s more surprised than she is. Julian&#x2019;s relentless energy and his extraordinary intellect electrify her, but she&#x2019;s baffled by his sudden interest. Why would this handsome British billionaire Manhattan&#x2019;s most eligible bachelor pursue a pretty but bookish young banker who hasn&#x2019;t had a boyfriend since college?The answer is beyond imagining . . . at least at first. Kate and Julian&#x2019;s story may have begun not in the moneyed world of twenty-first-century Manhattan but in France during World War I, when a mysterious American woman emerged from the shadows of the Western Front to save the life of Captain Julian Laurence Ashford, a celebrated war poet and infantry officer.Now, in modern-day New York, Kate and</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Beatriz Williams</b> lives&nbsp;with her husband and children&nbsp;in Greenwich, Connecticut. <i>Overseas </i>is her first novel.&nbsp;<p>I knew it was a dream, a nightmare, but still I couldn&#x2019;t break free into consciousness. I kicked upward toward the surface, thrusting with all my might, until my lungs burst with a scream that wouldn&#x2019;t release. Someone called to me: distant, urgent.</p><p>And then I emerged, sweating, with Julian&#x2019;s arms around me and his voice murmuring in my ear. &#x201c;Sweetheart, wake up. Kate, it&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned blindly into his chest. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; I said, between heaving gasps of air. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m here. Shh. Of course I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>He held me against his body, enfolding me with himself, and gradually the panic died down. I concentrated on breathing slowly, on grasping at the solid physical details around me, anchoring me to reality: the sheets, the faint glow from the nightlight, the cool air entering my nose. Julian&#x2019;s skin pressed into mine.</p><p>&#x201c;Better?&#x201d; he asked, after a minute.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>A low chuckle rumbled from his throat. &#x201c;Your first nightmare already. Is it all so very dreadful?&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted into his chest. &#x201c;Terrible. A severe case of endorphin overload. I may not live through the night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rubbish,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;<i>My</i> endorphins are jolly well singing in my ears, and I&#x2019;m not moaning on about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; I snaked my hand along his side and administered a sharp tickle. &#x201c;I definitely heard moaning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look here. <i>Stop</i> that. Stop it, I say. <i>Kate</i>!&#x201d; He doubled over and tried to roll away without falling off the bed.</p><p>I began laughing. &#x201c;Oh my God. You&#x2019;re <i>ticklish</i>. Come back here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am <i>not</i> . . . Kate, you&#x2019;re <i>rubbish</i> . . . stop that <i>at once</i>!&#x201d; His frantic hands manacled mine at last; he flipped me onto my back and held my wrists above my head. &#x201c;Minx,&#x201d; he muttered, kissing me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll pay for that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just . . . <i>full</i> of lovely . . . secrets . . . aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I giggled, around his kisses.</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; His body began to transform, to mold itself to mine; his lips edged downward, damp and scorching, along my throat and breasts. He drawled: &#x201c;But not nearly as many as you, sweetheart.&#x201d;</p><p>What is it, really, that makes a man a good lover? <i>Beloved, I&#x2019;ll do my best, but I&#x2019;m rather a novice at all this</i>, he&#x2019;d said last night, fumbling with the hooks of my bra, and yet he&#x2019;d gone on as if he possessed the secret map to my body: discovering hidden points of sensitivity I never knew existed, touching my flesh with a preternatural sensual attunement, delivering himself to me with every stroke. He allowed no hiding under sheets, no closed eyes, no defense whatsoever. It was like falling backward into a pit of extraordinary depth, trusting him to catch me; the most exquisite, excruciating vulnerability, made bearable only by the certainty that he felt it, too.</p><p>We lay afterward in tranquility, in wordless communion, hardly able to move; I on my side, one leg buried between his, studying the pattern our woven fingers made against his chest. I could feel his other hand tangle through my hair. His flushed skin seemed to melt downward through mine, layer by layer. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; I heard myself say, dreamlike, &#x201c;are you absolutely sure you haven&#x2019;t had any lovers in twelve years?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me think a moment.&#x201d; A dramatic pause, and then: &#x201c;Yes. Yes, quite sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kate!&#x201d; His head tilted upward. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re <i>doubting</i> me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying, you seem to know your way around. How to please me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, I want to please you. I want to maintain you in a state of perfect drunken bliss. A dizzy hormonal stupor. Anything at all, you see, to entice you to soldier on with a lonely benighted chap who can&#x2019;t&#x201d;&#x2014;he kissed the tip of my nose&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>quite</i> seem to see his way without you anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Idiot.&#x201d; I curled a lock of his hair tenderly around my finger.</p><p>He drew his hand along the curve of my waist, his smile deepening as he went. &#x201c;Besides, it seems to me, since <i>my</i> pleasure is more or less a foregone conclusion, the main object of the exercise ought to be <i>your</i> pleasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm. I never thought of it that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A rather elusive creature, I&#x2019;ve heard. Fascinating sort of quarry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute. You&#x2019;re <i>hunting down</i> my orgasms?&#x201d;</p><p>His laughter burst out like a rifle salute. &#x201c;Kate. You damned magnificent creature.&#x201d; He rolled onto his back, bringing me with him. &#x201c;Yes, my darling. That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;d like to do, on and on until the end of my life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re off to a flying start, I have to admit.&#x201d;</p><p>He said nothing to that, only tucked my hair behind one ear with a shadowed smile. His eyes had lost all color in the dimness, depthless and unreadable. &#x201c;So do you mind telling me about it?&#x201d; he asked at last. &#x201c;Your dream?&#x201d;</p><p>I folded my arms across his chest and rested my chin. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s stupid. Just an anxiety dream. I get them every so often. Kind of ridiculous, since you&#x2019;re the war hero; I should be soothing away <i>your</i> nightmares.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you anxious about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I usually only have them before a big meeting, some sort of performance.&#x201d; I touched his lower lip. &#x201c;I had one the night before we met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were nervous?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God. Was I <i>nervous</i>? Do you have any idea how intimidating you are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am? I thought I was rather a nice chap, actually.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, incredulous, and slid back down to rest against his side. &#x201c;Julian, you have kind of a hard-ass reputation, in a business setting. No offense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I could hear the bafflement in his voice. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m still giving you anxiety dreams?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe. It&#x2019;s my subconscious, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve managed to convince your conscious mind, but your subconscious still thinks I&#x2019;m a bounder?&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. &#x201c;Hold on. <i>I&#x2019;m</i> the over-analyzer in this relationship, okay? Look, it&#x2019;s no big deal.&#x201d; I squeezed my eyes, forcing out the details. &#x201c;I think it was like the one I had the night before our meeting. I can&#x2019;t really recall it exactly. Just kind of panicky, trying to explain something to someone. Someone dear to me. You, maybe? And that person, that man, drifting slowly away from me, not understanding, and the panic sort of paralyzing me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Explain what, exactly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Something important. Something vital. Life or death.&#x201d; I opened my eyes to Julian&#x2019;s face, taut and intent beneath the shadows, and tried to push away the feeling of dread that insinuated itself into my brain as I spoke. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s like we&#x2019;re speaking two different languages, and the harder I try, the further away he floats. Bizarre, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>He tucked my head under his chin and began to stroke my hair. &#x201c;Kate,&#x201d; he said hoarsely, &#x201c;Kate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said, into the hollow of his throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just my silly neurotic brain. Nothing to do with you. I <i>trust</i> you.&#x201d;</p><p>He said nothing for a long time, only went on caressing my hair: long regular strokes to the very tips, letting the strands slip away from his fingertips to rest on my back and shoulders. I let my eyelids sink downward, savoring the tickle-soft sensation. Eventually I felt his voice stir the air above my head. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t drift away, Kate. I won&#x2019;t fail you.&#x201d; He said it fiercely, as if he were trying to convince himself.</p><p>&#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; I said, more to comfort him than myself, and stretched myself luxuriously against the solid mass of his body. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so hard on yourself.&#x201d; I yawned. I was beginning to feel drowsy again, despite the clinging uneasiness.</p><p>&#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Way too hard.&#x201d; I put my arm across his chest and closed my eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to be perfect, you know. I just need you to be <i>you</i>. To be . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;my brain was beginning to float&#x2014;&#x201d; . . . to be mine.&#x201d;</p><p>He made a noise of some kind; I couldn&#x2019;t quite tell whether it was a chuckle or a groan. &#x201c;Yours always, darling. Now go to sleep. No more nightmares. You&#x2019;re safe, now. I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; I heard him say, somewhere near my ear. It was the last thing I heard before drifting off, hoping sleep would dissolve the knot of foreboding in my belly.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t there, though, when I woke up. My new BlackBerry sat on the pillow in his place, with an e-mail at the top of my inbox.</p><p>Beloved, I must be mad, to tear myself from your side like this. Sleep late and enjoy yourself. I left the Rover for you. Go find some alluring frock and meet me at the Lyme Inn at 8pm.

Very Boring Alligator just doesn't seem to get it. The Gator Cops are called in to assist--but then THEY won't go away. With all these unwanted guests romping on the couch, somebody will have to take charge! Luckily, a very resourceful little girl is ready to put her foot down . . .<br><br>Jean Gralley's offbeat sense of humor and wonderfully animated illustrations turn an awkward social situation into a very entertaining tale. <br></p><p>Jean Gralley studied illustration under Maurice Sendak. She made her picture book debut with <i>Hogula, Dread Pig of Nigh</i>t. She lives in Potomac Falls,Virginia, where she creates picture books and is the Staff Artist for <i>Cricket Magazine</i>.<br>An obstinate alligator, an equally tenacious redheaded girl and an irresistible purple couch take center stage in Gralley's (Hogula, Dread Pig of Night) imaginative tale of a play date gone awry. Snappy, simple rhymes relate the girl's frustration when a reptile who came to play won't budge from her couch. "All I really wanted/ was to slouch upon my couch./ But Gator made me grumpy, oh,/ that Gator made me grouch." She resorts to calling the handlebar-mustached, bobby hat-wearing Gator Raiders, who come "with sirens wailin' and their gator poles a-flailin'." But rather than oust him, they rambunctiously join the alligator on the alluring couch. The gouache-and-ink artwork reflects this crescendo of action as white backdrops give way to bright yellow and orange geometric patterns with the words "Wheeee" and "Yahooooo" worked into the foray of color. Only when the expressive redhead's thunderous commands of "STOP!" get results does the background return to a calmer pale yellow and then to white. "Oh! Now I get it!" the raiders and the alligator sheepishly acknowledge in cartoon bubbles. When the girl finally relaxes on her couch with a loud "Ahhhhhhhhh" (and a "See you later, alligator") she realizes she is the "Boss of Play, every day!" Bosses of Play everywhere will cheer on this heroine. Ages 4-8. (Sept.) <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Better Together: Restoring the American Community</h2><p><p> In his acclaimed bestselling book, <i>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</i>, Robert Putnam described a thirty-year decline in America's social institutions. The book ended with the hope that new forms of social connection might be invented in order to revive our communities. </p><p> In <i>Better Together</i>, Putnam and longtime civic activist Lewis Feldstein describe some of the diverse locations and most compelling ways in which civic renewal is taking place today. In response to civic crises and local problems, they say, hardworking, committed people are reweaving the social fabric all across America, often in innovative ways that may turn out to be appropriate for the twenty-first century. </p><p> <i>Better Together</i> is a book of stories about people who are building communities to solve specific problems. The examples Putnam and Feldstein describe span the country from big cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs, small Mississippi and Wisconsin towns, and quiet rural areas. The projects range from the strictly local to that of the men and women of UPS, who cover the nation. <i>Bowling Alone</i> looked at America from a broad and general perspective. <i>Better Together</i> takes us into Catherine Flannery's Roxbury, Massachusetts, living room, a UPS loading dock in Greensboro, North Carolina, a Philadelphia classroom, the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, naval shipyard, and a Bay Area Web site. </p><p> We meet activists driven by their visions, each of whom has chosen to succeed by building community: Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley who want paved roads, running water, and decent schools; Harvard University clerical workers searching for respect and improved working conditions; Waupun, Wisconsin, schoolchildren organizing to improve safety at a local railroad crossing; and merchants in Tupelo, Mississippi, joining with farmers to improve their economic status. As the stories in <i>Better Together</i> demonstrate, bringing people together by building on personal relationships remains one of the most effective strategies to enhance America's social health.</p></p><p><b>Robert D. Putnam</b> is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at Harvard University and founder of the Saguaro Seminar, a program dedicated to fostering civic engagement in America. He is the author or coauthor of ten previous books, including <i>Bowling Alone</i>, and is former dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and past president of the American Political Science Association. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Putnam's much praised Bowling Alone put the concept of social capital (social networking) into broad currency by remarking on its growing absence. Now the Harvard prof and fellow public policy expert Feldstein approach the issue from the opposite direction: without suggesting communitarianism is sweeping the nation, they offer a dozen case studies of what groups of varying size have accomplished by cultivating networks of mutual assistance. Examples range from a neighborhood subdivision in Boston to an entire Mississippi county as well as the "virtual community" of Craigslist, an online bulletin board that has become the prime "go-to" source for job and apartment listings in San Francisco and elsewhere. The authors stress the importance of participatory involvement, championing networks that create opportunities for people to find their own public voice rather than relying on organizers to speak for them. Thus, one chapter recounts a New Hampshire public arts project in which townspeople's stories created the structure of an interpretive dance about a local shipyard's history; another chapter has schoolchildren in Wisconsin writing to local and state leaders to propose public improvements. Though each group is, as one person puts it, "recreating our neighborhood into the kind of village we want it to be," the book emphasizes no particular approach, juxtaposing the work of local governments with neighborhood associations and churchgoers with union organizers. The overarching argument, supported anecdotally rather than statistically, is tentative-something's going on but it's too early to tell how big it might become-but Putnam's reputation will guarantee the book a hearing.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dead Simple</h2><p>Michael Harrison had it all: good looks, charm, natural leadership, a wicked sense of humor, and now, Ashley, his fianc�e. While out celebrating with a group of friends a few nights before the wedding, Michael suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself enclosed in a coffin equipped only with a flashlight, a dirty magazine, a walkie-talkie, and a tiny breathing tube. It's all in good fun &#x2014; payback for the grief his mates suffered due to his own penchant for tomfoolery &#x2014; that is until the four are killed in a drunk driving accident just moments after leaving Michael completely alone and buried alive.<br><br>Detective Superintendent Grace&#x2014;himself dealing with the pain of losing his wife&#x2014;is brought on to the case when Ashley reports Michael missing. Suspicions are raised when Michael's only friend not at the bachelor party refuses to cooperate, and Ashley's faithfulness&#x2014;not to mention her increasingly mysterious past&#x2014;are suddenly thrown in to question. As Superintendent Grace soon discovers, one man's disaster is another man's fortune.<br></p><p>Peter James is a noted crime writer in the UK and an internationally known film producer. He was the executive producer of the recent film adaptation of THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. This is his first novel in a series to feature Detective Superintendent Grace.British author James's far-fetched but terrifying thriller is the first of a new series featuring Det. Supt. Roy Grace. Michael Harrison, a successful real estate developer with a penchant for practical jokes, gets a horrible taste of his own medicine. As a prank, four of his friends bury Michael alive in a coffin equipped with a breathing tube and a bottle of whiskey and leave him, ostensibly for a couple of hours. But when their van crashes head-on into a truck and three of them are killed (the fourth dies later "in hospital"), Michael is trapped. His cell phone doesn't work, but he does have a two-way radio whose companion is in the hands of Davey, a mentally challenged young man who finds the phone near the scene of the accident. Grace, a detective with a taste for the supernatural (he uses mediums to help him solve crimes), gets on the case and discovers just how devious Michael's friends have been. The "buried alive" trope is undeniably powerful, and Grace shows promise as a hero&#x2014;but the crime and the plot surrounding Michael's plight are just too cumbersome and transparent to really engage the reader. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At now-legendary venues such as Threadgill's, Vulcan Gas Company, and the Armadillo World Headquarters, a host of country, rock-and-roll, blues, and folk musicians came together and created a sound and a scene that Jan Reid vividly detailed in his 1974 book, The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock.</p> <p>The breadth of talent still astounds&#x2014;Willie Nelson, Janis Joplin, Jerry Jeff Walker, Doug Sahm, Delbert McClinton, Michael Martin Murphey, Willis Alan Ramsey, Kinky Friedman, Steve Fromholz, Bobby Bridger, Billy Joe Shaver, Marcia Ball, and Townes Van Zandt. Reid's book even inspired the nationally popular and long-running PBS series Austin City Limits, which focused attention on the trends that fed the music scene&#x2014;progressive country, country rock, western swing, blues, and bluegrass among them.</p> <p>In this new edition, Jan Reid revitalizes his classic look at the Austin music scene. He has substantially reworked the early chapters to include musicians and musical currents from other parts of Texas that significantly contributed to the delightful convergence of popular cultures in Austin. Four new chapters and an epilogue show how the creative burst of the seventies directly spawned a new generation of talents who carry on the tradition&#x2014;Lyle Lovett, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Robert Earl Keen, Steve Earle, Jimmy LaFave, Kelly Willis, Joe Ely, Bruce and Charlie Robison, and The Dixie Chicks.</p></p><p>JAN REID, of Austin, Texas, is the author or coauthor of six books, including The Bullet Meant for Me: A Memoir.

He begins with Copernicus, during the Renaissance, when science replaced mysticism as a means of explaining the workings of the world, and he continues through the centuries, creating an unbroken genealogy of not only the greatest but also the more obscure names of Western science, a dot-to-dot line linking amateur to genius, and accidental discovery to brilliant deduction. </p><p>By focusing on the scientists themselves, Gribbin has written an anecdotal narrative enlivened with stories of personal drama, success and failure. A bestselling science writer with an international reputation, Gribbin is among the few authors who could even attempt a work of this magnitude. Praised as "a sequence of witty, information-packed tales" and "a terrific read" by The Times upon its recent British publication, The Scientists breathes new life into such venerable icons as Galileo, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Linus Pauling, as well as lesser lights whose stories have been undeservedly neglected. Filled with pioneers, visionaries, eccentrics and madmen, this is the history of science as it has never been told before.</p></p><p></p><h2>Apple T-Shirts: A Yearbook of History at Apple Computer</h2><p>"The journey begins."...

Now their adventure is with time itself. It starts when Eddy receives an unusually large packing crate from his mysterious uncle, Prince Krishna, containing an old-fashioned bicycle, complete with a wicker basket--the kind of bike no self-respecting boy like Eddy would be caught dead riding.</p><p>The bike possesses more than just a basket, however: It possesses the ability to travel through time, and soon Eddy is on the ride of his life!

Also well known for her mystery novels for adults, Ms. Langton lives in Lincoln, Massachusetts.</p>After 16 years of mostly mysteries for adults, Langton resurrects the Concord cast of <i>Fragile Flag</i> (1984) and its predecessors for a charming, if patchwork, time-travel tale. The expensive new bike that Eddy receives for his birthday is stolen, then replaced by an old-fashioned one from his royal Indian uncle. Meanwhile, local bank president Ralph Q. Preek has ordered Uncle Freddy and Aunt Alex to produce a vanished deed or vacate their rambling old house, and Eddy's older sister Eleanor is having fantods waiting for an in-crowd party invitation that never arrives. Once Eddy discovers that the old bicycle is a time machine, he, Eleanor, and his hamfisted friend Oliver each hare off into the past on ill-conceived adventures. Eleanor, for instance, wheels back to 1938 in a vain effort to save the life of movie star Derek Alabaster. Eddy, pushing off for Julius Caesar's time, ends up on a deserted beach after realizing too late that ancient Rome is far from Massachusetts in space as well as time. These parallel plot lines either dovetail in hyperconvenient fashion--a piece of paper that Eleanor just happens to pick up from the ground in 1938 turns out to be the missing deed--or trail away unresolved, creating a succession of loosely linked episodes but no unified story. Still, the major characters are easy to like (or, in Preek's case, despise), and the magical events are folded into the fabric of everyday life so neatly that they seem to belong there. <i>(Fiction. 10-12)</i> -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

"Enlightening . . . mesmerizing . . . luminously clear."--The New York Times.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>A view of Vietnam since America's involvement, by the author of perhaps the best book on the war, A Bright Shining Lie (1988). Here, Sheehan covers his visit to Vietnam in 1989 with his wife, Susan--who, with him, coauthored some of this material for a series of New Yorker articles and whom Sheehan credits here for her insight and her editing skills. Sheehan sees a Vietnam suffering not from the American war but from a prolonging of the agony by the rigid regime of Le Duan, with its prosecution of new wars and its Stalinist economics. In 1986, as General Giap relates in a longish and candid interview, came doi moi, or ``the new way.'' Out went the collective farms and heavy industrial projects; in came a free market. Within a year, Vietnam was exporting rice, and the currency had stabilized. Still, it's a desperately poor country, the North in particular, as Sheehan's tour of hospitals demonstrates: They are underequipped and cannot afford to stock antibiotics or basic vaccines. In Saigon, Sheehan is overcome with memories and seeks out his and Susan's old haunts, as well as those of John Vann, subject of much of A Bright Shining Lie. Like the North, the South is a society run by party faithful--and the privileges of rank have hearkened to them, leaving out a great many of the ``mutilated.'' Even so, the armies of homeless have been eliminated, and no one is starving. In Saigon, Western influence is strongest, ready for the moment when the American embargo drops and Vietnam becomes the economic powerhouse everyone is anticipating. Already the BMWs proliferate. Short but closely observed; essential for your Vietnam shelf. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In the summer of 1989, when Sheehan returned to Vietnam for the first time since covering the war for the New York Times , he found that despite the doi moi or "new way" programs, the economy was in bad shape. He learned, for instance, that the cost of stet one n in inoculate inoculating Vietnamese children against the deadly, fast-spreading Japanese encephalitis would exceed the entire national budget. Sheehan visited Hanoi and Saigon ("The South is Vietnam's California, and Saigon is its Los Angeles") and was disturbed by the corruption, shabbiness and poverty he saw. He contacted old acquaintances, visited sites familiar from the war--such as Ben Suc, the "most notoriously punished" village--and thought often of the late John Paul Vann, the central figure in his award-winning A Bright Shining Lie. Sheehan writes movingly of the ARVN veterans with missing limbs who wander the streets of Saigon. He closes this brief, thoughtful report with an account of his visit to an abandoned cemetery that was once intended to be the Vietnamese equivalent of Arlington National Cemetery. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Falconer: Book One of the Falconer Trilogy (The Falconer, 1)</h2><p><em>Debutante by day.

Gotta Go!</h2><p>An incredible journey<br><br>"I don't know much, but I know what I know. I gotta go! I gotta go! I gotta go to Mexico!" The creepy-crawly bug doesn't know why she does what she does. She only knows she has to do it. But making the journey seems impossible for the slow-moving critter, who has no idea what or where Mexico is. Then an everyday miracle occurs, bringing a transformation that will help her fulfill her destiny. Each autumn, millions of Monarch butterflies migrate from the central and eastern United States and Canada to colonies in the mountains of Mexico, where they mate before flying north in the spring to lay their eggs. In simple, jaunty text and pictures, Sam Swope and Sue Riddle celebrate the amazing story of one of these intrepid bugs.</p><p>Sam Swope is the author of two previous picture books, <i>The Krazees </i>and <i>The Araboolies of Liberty Street</i>. He lives in New York City. &nbsp;Sue Riddle lives in Providence, Rhode Island. This is her first book."I don't know much, but I know what I know. I gotta go! I gotta go! I gotta go to Mexico!" Through the experience of one tiny creepy-crawly, this small square book dramatizes the astonishing journey of the monarch butterfly, and the powerful instinct that drives it to fly as much as 3,000 miles from the U. S. to Mexico for the winter, then mate there and fly back north to lay its eggs. The small, uncluttered, line-and-watercolor pictures are set in lots of white space. The words are simple and urgent. Even preschoolers will feel the excitement about this most fragile of creatures that can fly so far and prove so strong. The miracle of the transformation is there on the page when the sturdy little insect emerges from the cocoon transformed into a butterfly, "orange and black and splendid," with gorgeous fluttering wings that nearly fill the page. Then there are pages where it flies and flies, and the butterfly is just a speck in the sky above farms and highways, forests and desert ("I am what I am and I know what I know, and make it or not, I gotta go!"). Like <i>Red-Eyed Tree Frog</i>, <i>Booklist</i>'s 1999 Top of the List for Nonfiction, this is a story that brings the wonder of the natural world right up close to a preschooler, without condescension or distortion. The rhythmic storytelling bears repeated readings, and many kids will want to go on from here to find out more about this astonishing creature. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Effective prayer life</h2><p>Product Details Paperback: 113 pages Publisher: Word For Today (2000)</p><p>Chuck Smith, senior pastor at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California, has been a Bible teacher for more than 60 years.

In the decades since, dozens of books have been written about the incandescent diva who transformed opera and the Promethean tycoon who revolutionized international shipping, but none has focused on the tempestuous relationship between them, which is widely thought to have collapsed following Onassis' celebrated marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy in 1968.<br><br>Now, Nicholas Gage, author of the acclaimed international best-seller Eleni and a former investigative reporter for the New York Times, gives us the first and only full account of this fateful romance, presenting startling new information he has uncovered. Gage was able to persuade the couple's associates, relatives, and close friends--some of whom had never spoken before--to share their most intimate recollections. He also gained access to some of Callas' most private papers, which provide an utterly new view of her personal life. His narrative shows us that the Callas and Onassis relationship, far from being a passing dalliance, was in fact the deepest and longest-lasting emotional commitment either of them ever knew.<br><br>Gage meticulously reconstructs the events leading to the affair, from Callas and Onassis' first meeting at a masked ball in Venice in 1957 to the tycoon's pursuit of her throughout Europe, culminating in the 1959 cruise. It was during this three-week summer holiday, hosted by Onassis and his wife, Tina, that Aristotle and Maria's daily encounters ignited passions before the alarmed eyes of the crew and other illustrious guests, including Sir Winston and Lady Churchill. We follow the couple through the ensuing press hysteria and the rancor of their shattered marriages; the days of bliss and battles on the island hideaway of Skorpios; the agonizing deterioration of Callas' voice; and the strange covert courtship Onassis conducted prior to his marriage to the widow of the American president, a surprise that stunned the world once again and nearly destroyed Callas. <br><br>Within days of his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, Onassis was back at Maria's door. Although they were never to marry, the relationship between the tycoon and the diva, Gage reveals, would continue and deepen, through tragedies and trials, until the end of their lives.<br><br>Penetrating the mass of published misinformation concerning his subjects, Nicholas Gage gives us the most reliable account ever of these legendary figures, a brilliant dual biography of two icons of the golden age of glamour. <b>Greek Fire</b> is an operatic spectacle of desire and loss, certain to transform our understanding of some of the most compelling personalities ever to capture our imagination.</p><p>Nicholas Gage's meticulously documented and consistently absorbing account chronicles the stormy love affair between Maria Callas (1923-77) and Aristotle Onassis (1906-75). Gage sees the soprano who reinvented the art of opera and the tycoon who transformed the shipping industry as kindred spirits, drawn into romance by a deep connection to their Greek origins and a shared sense that, despite all they had achieved, something was missing. They found that absent element in a once-in-a-lifetime passion, which Onassis betrayed by marrying Jacqueline Kennedy in 1968. Gage appears to share the view of the tycoon's Greek coterie, who viewed this marriage as an act of hubris that inevitably led to financial and personal reversals which embittered Onassis in his final years. But he doesn't blame the tycoon for Callas's decline, pointing out that by the time they met, she was already experiencing severe vocal problems and was eager for respite from her taxing performance commitments. In any case, her career and his business dealings take a back seat here to Gage's evocative portrait of his subjects' outsized personalities and the jet-set society in the gaudy postwar years. Some of the new information is revelatory, particularly Gage's persuasive contention that Callas bore Onassis a son who died hours after his birth in 1960. At other times his investigative-journalist approach seems too weighty for this highly personal story of love, rage, and big, big egos. Fortunately, these lapses don't seriously mar a text distinguished by smooth prose, the seamless interweaving of several narrative strands, and a warm sympathy for its genuinely tragic protagonists. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Nicholas Gage is the author of six other books, including the award-winning Eleni.

If you think that is too ambitious or wildly unrealistic, you need to read this book. His focus is on the one billion poorest individuals around the world who are caught in a poverty trap of disease, physical isolation, environmental stress, political instability, and lack of access to capital, technology, medicine, and education. The goal is to help these people reach the first rung on the "ladder of economic development" so they can rise above mere subsistence level and achieve some control over their economic futures and their lives. To do this, Sachs proposes nine specific steps, which he explains in great detail in <i>The End of Poverty</i>. Though his plan certainly requires the help of rich nations, the financial assistance Sachs calls for is surprisingly modest--more than is now provided, but within the bounds of what has been promised in the past. For the U.S., for instance, it would mean raising foreign aid from just 0.14 percent of GNP to 0.7 percent. Sachs does not view such help as a handout but rather an investment in global economic growth that will add to the security of all nations. In presenting his argument, he offers a comprehensive education on global economics, including why globalization should be embraced rather than fought, why international institutions such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank need to play a strong role in this effort, and the reasons why extreme poverty exists in the midst of great wealth. He also shatters some persistent myths about poor people and shows how developing nations can do more to help themselves.<p> Despite some crushing statistics, <i>The End of Poverty</i> is a hopeful book. Based on a tremendous amount of data and his own experiences working as an economic advisor to the UN and several individual nations, Sachs makes a strong moral, economic, and political case for why countries and individuals should battle poverty with the same commitment and focus normally reserved for waging war. This important book not only makes the end of poverty seem realistic, but in the best interest of everyone on the planet, rich and poor alike. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Jeffrey D.

Can the ancient Egyptians usefully be called black? Did the ancient Greeks borrow religion, science, and philosophy from the Egyptians and Phoenicians? Have scholars ignored the Afroasiatic roots of Western civilization as a result of racism and anti-Semitism? <br> In this collection of twenty essays, leading scholars in a broad range of disciplines confront the claims made by Martin Bernal in <i>Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization</i>. In that work, Bernal proposed a radical reinterpretation of the roots of classical civilization, contending that ancient Greek culture derived from Egypt and Phoenicia and that European scholars have been biased against the notion of Egyptian and Phoenician influence on Western civilization. The contributors to this volume argue that Bernal's claims are exaggerated and in many cases unjustified. <br> Topics covered include race and physical anthropology; the question of an Egyptian invasion of Greece; the origins of Greek language, philosophy, and science; and racism and anti-Semitism in classical scholarship. In the conclusion to the volume, the editors propose an entirely new scholarly framework for understanding the relationship between the cultures of the ancient Near East and Greece and the origins of Western civilization. <br> The contributors are: John Baines, professor of Egyptology, University of Oxford Kathryn A.

In ``Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,'' the late poet Audre Lorde urges black women to recognize ``the kernel of the erotic'' within themselves and to expand it regardless of myths and images imposed upon them. In a striking pair of essays on interracial love, Essence magazine editor Audrey Edwards remembers fear, mutual misunderstanding, shared affection, and quite a bit of ``raw, unrelenting sexual pleasure'' in her affairs and relationships with different kinds of white men, and novelist Bebe Moore Campbell reexamines her pain and fury over black men who date and mate with white women. In ``Letting Go With Love,'' teacher Miriam DeCosta-Willis writes about the loss of long-term love and sex with her black husband, while in ``Black Men Do Feel about Love,'' psychotherapist Audrey B. Chapman analyzes the failure of communication between black men and black women as a failure to understand black men's isolation and fear of dependency. Other contributors include Tina McElroy Ansa, Marcia Ann Gillespie, Jewelle Gomez, Sonia Sanchez, and Ntozake Shange. Women on the cutting edge of sexuality, sexual ethics, and the exhilarating art of the personal essay. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in upstate New York. Gayle Ross, published author, storyteller and lecturer, is a descendant of John Ross, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation during the &#34;Trail of Tears.&#34; Her books, How Rabbit Tricked Otter and The Girl Who Married the Moon have received glowing reviews.Bruchac and Ross (How Rabbit Tricked Otter) team up for a companion volume to Bruchac's Flying with Eagle, Racing with Great Bear, a collection of Native American tales that focused on boys' rites of passage. Here, girls or young women are the protagonists of 16 stories intended "to reach the daughters and granddaughters who will come after." Becoming a woman and marrying correctly are common themes: brave and resourceful heroines escape monsters and kidnappers, comically avoid marriage to trickster Owl or tragically die with their husbands. Unusual selections include "The Beauty Way," a recounting of an Apache rite of passage; "Stonecoat," the defeat of an evil and powerful medicine man by women who use the power of their "moontime"; and the title story, in which a girl not only marries the moon but shares his job with him. Comments on the stories open the four sections of the book (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest), each of which contains tales from four different nations (e.g., Penobscot, Seneca, Passamaquoddy and Mohegan for the Northeast). An afterword and source notes close this useful resource for storytelling and multicultural learning.

In our imaginary spaceship, let&#39;s check out the planets in our solar system. Mercury is closest, but it has no air, and it&#39;s either sizzling hot or bitterly cold. The atmosphere on Venus is poisonous; plus, human beings would cook there. Mars might work, but you&#39;d always have to be in a protective shelter. And if you got to the outer planets, you couldn&#39;t even land as they are mostly made of gas! Our home planet is looking good. Why is Earth so comfortable for plants, animals, and people? As Robert E. Wells explains, it&#39;s because of our just-right position form the sun, marvelous atmosphere, and abundant water. Our planet is very special and perfect for us, and that&#39;s why we must do all we can to keep Earth healthy.</p><p>Describes the planets in our solar system and compares them to Earth, the only planet where life can be supported.

Slavitt presents a graceful, accessible, and modern version for both longtime admirers of one of the great masterpieces of philosophical literature and those encountering it for the first time. Slavitt preserves the distinction between the alternating verse and prose sections in the Latin original, allowing us to appreciate the Menippian parallels between the discourses of literary and logical inquiry. His prose translations are lively and colloquial, conveying the argumentative, occasionally bantering tone of the original, while his verse translations restore the beauty and power of Boethius&#x2019;s poetry. The result is a major contribution to the art of translation. </p><p> Those less familiar with <i>Consolation</i> may remember it was written under a death sentence. Boethius (c. 480&#x2013;524), an Imperial official under Theodoric, Ostrogoth ruler of Rome, found himself, in a time of political paranoia, denounced, arrested, and then executed two years later without a trial. Composed while its author was imprisoned, cut off from family and friends, it remains one of Western literature&#x2019;s most eloquent meditations on the transitory nature of earthly belongings, and the superiority of things of the mind. In an artful combination of verse and prose, Slavitt captures the energy and passion of the original. And in an introduction intended for the general reader, Seth Lerer places Boethius&#x2019;s life and achievement in context. </p></p><p><b>David R. Slavitt</b> is a poet and the translator of more than ninety works of fiction, poetry, and drama.Slavitt, a poet and translator of over 80 works of fiction, poetry, and drama, presents a new translation of this philosophical classic directed at general readers. Written under the threat of Boethius's impending execution, the work comes on the cusp between the classical and medieval worlds. In alternating prose and verse, Boethius spins a dialog concerning the harsh vicissitudes of fortune and the lasting happiness provided by the life of the mind. Slavitt's prose translation is accessible and makes frequent use of colloquialisms. His poetic translations&#x2014;too often paraphrased in earlier editions&#x2014;are not weighed down with attempted fidelities to ancient meter and use contemporary forms to evoke the gravity and grace of the original. While the book does include a brief biographical and textual introduction by Seth Lerer (English &amp; comparative literature, Stanford Univ.), its lack of textual apparatus makes this edition less than ideal for students. It does succeed, however, as a springboard for personal reflection and a source of literate pleasure.

Living in a poor neighborhood of the small Mexican town San Miguel de Allende, Morris befriends a neighbor, Lupe, who is struggling to support her many children (fathered by three different men) and to cope with her current, openly unfaithful partner. Scenes of life in San Miguel alternate with Morris's voyages around Central America, from the historic ruins of Teotihuac�n to the contemporary turmoil of Nicaragua under the Sandinistas. Memories of her past crowd in: her parents' tense marriage, which sparked the restlessness that keeps their daughter on the road; her difficult relationships with often cruel men; the desolation of the years prior to her departure for San Miguel. Neither her affection for Lupe nor her love affair with a Mexico City man can prevent Morris's eventual return to the U.S., but her eloquent, elegant prose makes it clear that the grim, grand landscape and its tenacious inhabitants have left an indelible imprint on her soul. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Praise for <i>Nothing to Declare</i>:<p> "She is a fascinating guide, with an eye for the brutal, the garish, the silly, and the bizarre....The energy of her motion carries the reader with her." --<i>Time</i></p><p> "The union of a travel book and journey into the self.

The Qirsi leaders, Weavers whose powerful magic could bend to their will not only the elements but also the thoughts of others, were all killed. The rest of the pale-skinned Qirsi were scattered throughout the realm. They were no longer a threat without their multi-talented leaders.<br><br>But though most Qirsi live normal lives, and some even serve lords as advisors, all is not well in the realm. There is a Weaver in the Forelands again, secretly sowing seeds of rebellion against the physically hardier but unmagical Eandi.<br><br>Lord Tavis of Curgh, raised to succeed his father as duke, and engaged to the beautiful Lady Brienne of Kentigern, seems bound for greatness. But just as his life seems complete, he is accused of a horrific act. Little can Tavis know that the Weaver is using him as a pawn in a vast plot.<br><br>Now, only a Qirsi gleaner can help Tavis survive his doom, reclaim his good name, and prevent a devastating civil war in the Forelands.<br><br></p><p>Magic and mayhem, politics and personal sacrifice weave a sophisticated tapestry in this first in an epic fantasy series from award-winner David B. Coe. Once, the magic-wielding Qirsi fought the Eandi clans for control of the Forelands. Defeated by a traitor, the Qirsi have been uneasily absorbed into Eandi society, serving as councilors to the powerful, but they are still mistrusted. Now a Qirsi faction hopes to subvert the rules of ascension to the Eandi throne. Tavis, a young noble in line for the kingship, becomes a target of the conspiracy and finds that he must turn to an unlikely source for help--a powerful and enigmatic Qirsi who may be more than he seems. <p> The opening chapters take the time to develop the politics, history, and customs of the Forelands. The patient reader will be rewarded with adventure, betrayal, love, and hope set against a well-realized blend of epic events and the beginning of Tavis's personal hero-quest. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p>David B. Coe embarks on an ambitious new series set in a region whose clans have fought each other for power for as long as anyone can remember. Hundreds of years ago, the Qirsi War changed everything. Hoping to conquer the Forelands, the Qirsi, physically slight but with potent magic by which they create fire, weave mists and winds, foretell the future, mind-speak, shape matter and cloud men&#39;s minds, attacked the clans, streaming across the mountains separating their home from the northern tribes. But when the Qirsi were defeated in an act of savage betrayal, many were slaughtered, and the rest dispersed among the seven realms of the Forelands. The Weavers -- Qirsi who could bind together the magic of many Qirsi -- were all executed. After centuries of uneasy peace, an assassin kills a royal heir whose wedding would have united two realms. A new war erupts, one that threatens to be even more devastating and vicious than the Qirsi War, re-igniting ancient hatreds, upsetting the rules of ascension that have stabilized the leadership of the lands, and throwing the realms into a maelstrom of intrigue and violence.</p><h2>Guiding Your Family in a Misguided World</h2><p>Parental help for creating a stable, Christ-centered home and developing a strong personal faith.</p><p></p><h2>How to Help Gun Dogs Train Themselves</h2><p>Save time by training your gun dog the easy, painless and fun way. <p>The most critical developmental time for dogs is the first 16 weeks of life. Since puppies usually go to their new owners between 8 and 12 weeks of age, only a few short weeks remain for the dog's potential to be tapped. Proper socialization, exposure and conditioning must take place within this time frame if behavioral problems such as not coming when called, not retrieving, or failure to point are to be avoided. </p><p>In the United States each year, over 8 million gun dogs work in unison with the 16 million people who have come to enjoy the thrill of hunting upland birds and waterfowl. </p><p>Of that number, thousands will spend approximately $600 to purchase a new pup within the next year only to find that unnecessary mistakes have ruined an otherwise fine gun dog's potential. </p><p>It doesn't have to be that way. One of America's great dog people, and veteran editor of The Gun Dog Supreme, Joan Bailey, guides both new and experienced dog owners through that all important first year of their new puppy's life with her book--"How To Help Gun Dogs Train Themselves." </p><p>Designed in an easy to read, step-by-step format. "How To Help Gun Dogs Train Themselves" assists gun dog owners by providing proven methods emphasizing socialization, exposure and conditioning during the critical first 12 months of a dogs life. Under the skillful direction of Joan Bailey, gun dog enthusiasts will learn what thousands of successful bird hunters have known for years--with a little help gun dogs really train themselves. </p><p>Now in it's 3rd edition, updated with new material, over 206 information packed pages, more than 130 photographs.</p></p><p>More than anything else, this book&#39;s continuing popularity spreads by word of mouth. Some readers call it their &#34;bible&#34; for raising a young hunting dog. Many breeders insist that their buyers must have the book, and that they have it weeks before they get their pup. Some breeders provide a copy for the buyer.Essentially, this is a book about exposing your young dog to proper conditioning during his or her first year. The book was born out of more than thirty-five years of experience of working with puppies, young hunting dogs, their owners, and my association with many knowledgeable people in the world of gun dogs. They have all contributed their wealth of knowledge to my understanding of these wonderful dogs.</p><h2>Icon of Evil: Hitler&#39;s Mufti and the Rise of Radical Islam</h2><p>A chilling, fascinating, and nearly forgotten historical figure is resurrected in a riveting work that links the fascism of the last century with the terrorism of our own. Written with verve and extraordinary access to primary sources in several languages, Icon of Evil is the definitive account of the man who during World War II was called &#x201c;the f�hrer of the Arab world&#x201d; and whose ugly legacy lives on today.<br><br>In 1921, the beneficiary of an appointment the British would live to regret, Haj Amin al-Husseini became the mufti of Jerusalem, the most eminent and influential Islamic leader in the Middle East. For years, al-Husseini fomented violence in the region against the Jews he loathed and wished to destroy. Forced out in 1937, he eventually found his way to the country whose legions he desperately wished to join: Nazi Germany.<br><br>Here, with new and disturbing details, David G. Dalin and John F. Rothmann show how al-Husseini ingratiated himself with his hero, Adolf Hitler, becoming, with his blonde hair and blue eyes, an &#x201c;honorary Aryan,&#x201d; while dreaming of being installed Nazi leader of the Middle East. Al-Husseini would later recruit more than 100,000 Muslims in Europe to fight in divisions of the Waffen-SS, and obstruct negotiations with the Allies that might have allowed four thousand Jewish children to escape to Palestine. Some believe that al-Husseini even inspired Hitler to implement the Final Solution. At war&#x2019;s end, al-Husseini escaped indictment at Nuremberg and was harbored in France before being given a hero&#x2019;s welcome in Egypt.<br><i><br>Icon of Evil </i>chronicles al-Husseini&#x2019;s postwar relationships with such influential Islamic figures as the radical theoretician Sayyid Qutb and Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s powerful uncle, General Khairallah Talfah, and his crucial mentoring of the young Yasser Arafat. Finally, it provides compelling evidence that al-Husseini&#x2019;s actions and writings serve as inspirations today to the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations pledged to destroy Israel and the United States.<br>Revelatory and unsettling, <i>Icon of Evil </i>reveals an essential character in the worst crimes of the modern era. It is an important addition to our understanding of the past, present, and future of radical Islam.</p><p>David G. Dalin is the Taube Research Fellow in American History at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He is the author, co-author, or editor of nine books, including <i>Religion and State in the American Jewish Experience</i> (with Jonathan D. Sarna), <i>The Presidents of the United States and the Jews,</i> and <i>The Myth of Hitler&#x2019;s Pope.</i> His numerous articles and book reviews have appeared in <i>American Jewish History, Commentary, First Things, The Weekly Standard</i>, and the <i>American Jewish Year Book</i>. <br><br>John F. Rothmann serves on the faculty of the Fromm Institute at the University of San Francisco. He is an author, teacher, archivist, political consultant, and talk show host on the ABC-affiliated KGO 810-AM Newstalk Radio in San Francisco. He has lectured on American politics and the presidency and the Middle East throughout the United States, Canada, and Israel.In the last century, Arab peoples have frequently fared poorly under leaders chosen by or foisted upon them, including Egypt&#x2019;s Nasser, Syria&#x2019;s Assad, and Iraq&#x2019;s Hussein. Among the most destructive of these was Haj Amin al-Husseini, who dominated Palestinian politics for several critical decades of the twentieth century. This account of the life and career of al-Husseini is interesting and disturbing but hardly balanced. If the authors&#x2019;&nbsp;goal&nbsp;is to show the venality of their subject and the tragic consequences for Palestinians, they succeed admirably. As Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, al-Husseini maintained his personal and family powers like a gangster. His nationalist aspirations manifested themselves in the form of rabid Jew baiting that went far beyond opposition to Zionism, and the authors conclusively show how he promoted the extermination of Jews while he resided in Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. However, their effort to link al-Husseini to the rise of contemporary radical Islam is&nbsp;unconvincing. Still, this is a useful work that helps explain the sad legacy of Palestinian political life. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>The New Black: Mourning Melancholia And Depression</h2><p>The New Black is Darian Leader&#39;s compassionate and illuminating exploration of melancholy What happens when we lose someone we love? A death, a separation or the break-up of a relationship are some of the hardest times we have to live through. We may fall into a nightmare of depression, lose the will to live and see no hope for the future. What matters at this crucial point is whether or not we are able to mourn. In this important and groundbreaking book, acclaimed psychoanalyst and writer Darian Leader urges us to look beyond the catch-all concept of depression to explore the deeper, unconscious ways in which we respond to the experience of loss. In so doing, we can loosen the grip it may have upon our lives. &#39;His orthodox, psychoanalytical approach, produces an unpredictable, occasionally brilliant book.

He practises psychoanalysis in London, and he is a member of the College of Psychoanalysts and a founding member of the Centre for Freudian Analysis and Research.Leader&#x2014;the British psychoanalyst who famously described shrinks as mutants scavenging after a nuclear holocaust&#x2014;gives the profession a sound scolding for mishandling and misunderstanding depression. Our current idea of depression, he says, was created to fit the symptoms (such as insomnia and lack of appetite) that antidepressants treat. Leader goes back to Freud's classic 1917 essay, Mourning and Melancholia, to show what depression is really about: the loss of an important relationship. He presents a thorough and thoughtful review of what happens when the work of mourning (detaching ourselves from the loved ones we have lost) or melancholia (where what is lost is not so obvious to the patient) goes undone. He also rails at the erosion of public mourning rituals that can ease the process. Leader manages to bring not just a fresh look at Freud and grieving but adds rich context from his own case studies and the culture around us, from John Cleese's hilarious eulogy for his Monty Python colleague Graham Chapman to <i>Brokeback Mountain.</i> It's an astounding analysis of a pressing mental health issue that melds old and new. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The creator of a pantheon of characters who have been immortalized in books and plays, he provided readers throughout the world with a fascinating window into the world of Eastern European Jews as they began to confront the forces of cultural, political, and religious modernity that tore through the Russian Empire in the final decades of the nineteenth century.<br>&nbsp;<br>But just as compelling as the fictional lives of Tevye, Golde, Menakhem-Mendl, and Motl was Sholem Aleichem&#x2019;s own life story. Born Sholem Rabinovich in Ukraine in 1859, he endured an impoverished childhood, married into fabulous wealth, and then lost it all through bad luck and worse business sense. Turning to his pen to support himself, he switched from writing in Russian and Hebrew to Yiddish, in order to create a living body of literature for the Jewish masses. He enjoyed spectacular success as both a writer and a performer of his work throughout Europe and the United States, and his death in 1916 was front-page news around the world; a <i>New York Times</i> editorial mourned the loss of &#x201c;the Jewish Mark Twain.&#x201d; But &nbsp;his greatest fame lay ahead of him, as the English-speaking world began to discover his work in translation and to introduce his characters to an audience that would extend beyond his wildest dreams. In Jeremy Dauber&#x2019;s magnificent biography, we encounter a Sholem Aleichem for the ages.<br><br>(With 16 pages of black-and-white illustrations)</p></p><p><p><b>JEREMY DAUBER</b>&nbsp;is a professor of Yiddish literature at Columbia University, where he also serves as director of its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and teaches in the American Studies program. His previous books include <i>In the Demon&#x2019;s Bedroom: Yiddish Literature and the Early Modern </i>and <i>Antonio&#x2019;s Devils: Writers of the Jewish Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature</i>. He lives in New York City.</p><p><b>Chapter 1<br></b><i>In Which We Begin Near the Very End<br></i>1915&#x2013;1859<br><br>The Bronx, late 1915.<br>&nbsp;<br>Late at night, the man the world knows as Sholem Aleichem wanders the streets, remembering. He is fifty-six but, to our eyes, looks older: almost seven years of battling tuberculosis has taken its toll, and though he has had periods of good health, he has gotten sicker and sicker while in New York. The noise and chaos of the city have never agreed with him; he has never quite managed to find his footing in its booming Yiddish literary and cultural life&#x2014;not now, and not when he was last here, almost a decade ago. He misses the warmth of the Italian Riviera; he misses his friends from Russia, separated not only by distance, but by war (the United States has yet to commence hostilities, but he has seen trainloads of refugees and sailed through mine-infested waters; he is well aware of the Great War). A still greater personal tragedy, the death of his oldest son, has just devastated the family, and he has recently composed his will.<br>&nbsp;<br>Always an insomniac by nature, given to writing late into the night, he leaves his apartment at 968 Kelly Street, right off Westchester Avenue and a block from the 163rd Street subway stop, and walks the neighborhood, a little like his beloved Dickens used to do, spending his time in the past, trying to recall his life&#x2019;s details for his autobiography.<br>&nbsp;<br>From near the very beginning, he had known his life would make good copy. Twenty years earlier, he&#x2019;d told his good friend, fellow writer, and sometime competitor Mordkhe Spektor that he would write a lengthy account of his first twenty years; &#x201c;a man&#x2019;s life [is] the finest novel,&#x201d; he wrote him, &#x201c;and mine is rich with episodes, characters and types.&#x201d; But life&#x2014;that rich, varied life&#x2014;had gotten in the way, and he had put off recording it until 1908, when a grave illness provided him, as he put it, &#x201c;the privilege of meeting his majesty, the Angel of Death, face to face.&#x201d; Writing an autobiography and making a will were almost the same thing, he once said, and though he composed a few chapters on his sickbed in Italy, he pushed it off as his health improved, preferring, as he so often did, to concentrate on looking forward rather than back. He wrote a critic four years later that he felt so young, so vital, that he would never finish an autobiographical account; there would always be more to the story.<br>&nbsp;<br>But other factors intervened, which we&#x2019;ll return to in their proper time, and in three short but eventful years that vitality had waned: the work once titled <i>Step by Step</i>, with its sense of movement, energy, forward progress, was being serialized in the Yiddish press under the title From the Fair. Explaining the choice of name, especially the preposition, he wrote: &#x201c;A man heading for a fair is full of hope. He has no idea what bargains he will find and what he will accomplish&nbsp;. . . don&#x2019;t bother him, he has no time. But on the way back he knows what deals he has made and what he has accomplished. He&#x2019;s no longer in a hurry&nbsp;. . . He can assess the results of his venture.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Though he was still writing, he had, in his mind, already left the fair behind.</p></p><h2>Thunderstruck</h2><p>In <i>Thunderstruck</i>, Erik Larson tells the interwoven stories of two men&#x2014;Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication&#x2014;whose lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time.<br><br>Set in Edwardian London and on the stormy coasts of Cornwall, Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia, <i>Thunderstruck</i> evokes the dynamism of those years when great shipping companies competed to build the biggest, fastest ocean liners, scientific advances dazzled the public with visions of a world transformed, and the rich outdid one another with ostentatious displays of wealth. Against this background, Marconi races against incredible odds and relentless skepticism to perfect his invention: the wireless, a prime catalyst for the emergence of the world we know today. Meanwhile, Crippen, &#x201c;the kindest of men,&#x201d; nearly commits the perfect crime.<br><br>With his superb narrative skills, Erik Larson guides these parallel narratives toward a relentlessly suspenseful meeting on the waters of the North Atlantic. Along the way, he tells of a sad and tragic love affair that was described on the front pages of newspapers around the world, a chief inspector who found himself strangely sympathetic to the killer and his lover, and a driven and compelling inventor who transformed the way we communicate. <i>Thunderstruck</i> presents a vibrant portrait of an era of s�ances, science, and fog, inhabited by inventors, magicians, and Scotland Yard detectives, all presided over by the amiable and fun-loving Edward VII as the world slid inevitably toward the first great war of the twentieth century. Gripping from the first page, and rich with fascinating detail about the time, the people, and the new inventions that connect and divide us, <i>Thunderstruck</i> is splendid narrative history from a master of the form.</p><p>Erik Larson is the bestselling author of the National Book Award finalist and Edgar Award&#x2013;winning <i>The Devil in the White City</i>. He lives in Seattle with his wife, three daughters, and a dog named Molly.Chapter 1 <br><br>Ghosts and Gunfire Distraction <br><br>In the ardently held view of one camp, the story had its rightful beginning on the night of June 4, 1894, at 21 Albemarle Street, London, the address of the Royal Institution. Though one of Britain&#x2019;s most august scientific bodies, it occupied a building of modest proportion, only three floors. The false columns affixed to its facade were an afterthought, meant to impart a little grandeur. It housed a lecture hall, a laboratory, living quarters, and a bar where members could gather to discuss the latest scientific advances. <br>Inside the hall, a physicist of great renown readied himself to deliver the evening&#x2019;s presentation. He hoped to startle his audience, certainly, but otherwise he had no inkling that this lecture would prove the most important of his life and a source of conflict for decades to come. His name was Oliver Lodge, and really the outcome was his own fault&#x2014; another manifestation of what even he acknowledged to be a fundamental flaw in how he approached his work. In the moments remaining before his talk, he made one last check of an array of electrical apparatus positioned on a demonstration table, some of it familiar, most unlike anything seen before in this hall. <br>Outside on Albemarle Street the police confronted their usual traffic problem. Scores of carriages crowded the street and gave it the look of a great black seam of coal. While the air in the surrounding neighborhood of Mayfair was scented with lime and the rich cloying sweetness of hothouse flowers, here the street stank of urine and manure, despite the efforts of the young, red-shirted &#x201c;street orderlies&#x201d; who moved among the horses collecting ill-timed deposits. Officers of the Metropolitan Police directed drivers to be quick about exiting the street once their passengers had departed. The men wore black, the women gowns. <br>Established in 1799 for the &#x201c;diffusion of knowledge, and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical improvements,&#x201d; the Royal Institution had been the scene of great discoveries. Within its laboratories Humphry Davy had found sodium and potassium and devised the miner&#x2019;s safety lamp, and Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, the phenomenon whereby electricity running through one circuit induces a current in another. The institution&#x2019;s lectures, the &#x201c;Friday Evening Discourses,&#x201d; became so popular, the traffic outside so chaotic, that London officials were forced to turn Albemarle into London&#x2019;s first one-way street. <br>Lodge was a professor of physics at the new University College of Liverpool, where his laboratory was housed in a space that once had been the padded cell of a lunatic asylum. At first glance he seemed the embodiment of established British science. He wore a heavy beard misted with gray, and his head&#x2014;&#x201c;the great head,&#x201d; as a friend put it&#x2014;was eggshell bald to a point just above his ears, where his hair swept back into a tangle of curls. He stood six feet three inches tall and weighed about 210 pounds. A young woman once reported that the experience of dancing with Lodge had been akin to dancing with the dome of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral. <br>Though considered a kind man, in his youth Lodge had exhibited a cruel vein that, as he grew older, caused him regret and astonishment. While a student at a small school, Combs Rectory, he had formed a club, the Combs Rectory Birds&#x2019; Nest Destroying Society, whose members hunted nests and ransacked them, smashing eggs and killing fledglings, then firing at the parent birds with slingshots. Lodge recalled once beating a dog with a toy whip but dismissed this incident as an artifact of childhood cruelty. &#x201c;Whatever faults I may have,&#x201d; he wrote in his memoir, &#x201c;cruelty is not one of them; it is the one thing that is utterly repugnant.&#x201d; <br>Lodge had come of age during a time when scientists began to coax from the mists a host of previously invisible phenomena, particularly in the realm of electricity and magnetism. He recalled how lectures at the Royal Institution would set his imagination alight. &#x201c;I have walked back through the streets of London, or across Fitzroy Square, with a sense of unreality in everything around, an opening up of deep things in the universe, which put all ordinary objects of sense into the shade, so that the square and its railings, the houses, the carts, and the people, seemed like shadowy unrealities, phantasmal appearances, partly screening, but partly permeated by, the mental and spiritual reality behind.&#x201d; <br>The Royal Institution became for Lodge &#x201c;a sort of sacred place,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;where pure science was enthroned to be worshipped for its own sake.&#x201d; He believed the finest science was theoretical science, and he scorned what he and other like-minded scientists called &#x201c;practicians,&#x201d; the new heathen, inventors and engineers and tinkerers who eschewed theoretical research for blind experimentation and whose motive was commercial gain. Lodge once described the patent process as &#x201c;inappropriate and repulsive.&#x201d; <br>As his career advanced, he too was asked to deliver Friday Evening Discourses, and he reveled in the opportunity to put nature&#x2019;s secrets on display. When a scientific breakthrough occurred, he tried to be first to bring it to public notice, a pattern he had begun as early as 1877, when he acquired one of the first phonographs and brought it to England for a public demonstration, but his infatuation with the new had a corollary effect: a vulnerability to distraction. He exhibited a lofty dilettantism that late in life he acknowledged had been a fatal flaw. &#x201c;As it is,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;I have taken an interest in many subjects, and spread myself over a considerable range&#x2014;a procedure which, I suppose, has been good for my education, though not so prolific of results.&#x201d; Whenever his scientific research threatened to lead to a breakthrough, he wrote, &#x201c;I became afflicted with a kind of excitement which caused me to pause and not pursue that path to the luminous end. . . . It is an odd feeling, and has been the cause of my not clinching many subjects, not following up the path on which I had set my feet.&#x201d; <br>To the dismay of peers, one of his greatest distractions was the world of the supernatural. He was a member of the Society for Psychical&nbsp; Research, established in 1882 by a group of level-headed souls, mostly scientists and philosophers, to bring scientific scrutiny to ghosts, s�ances, telepathy, and other paranormal events, or as the society stated in each issue of its Journal, &#x201c;to examine without prejudice or prepossession and in a scientific spirit, those faculties of man, real or supposed, which appear to be inexplicable on any generally recognized hypothesis.&#x201d; The society&#x2019;s constitution stated that membership did not imply belief in &#x201c;physical forces other than those recognized by Physical Science.&#x201d; That the SPR had a Committee on Haunted Houses deterred no one. Its membership expanded quickly to include sixty university dons and some of the brightest lights of the era, among them John Ruskin, H. G. Wells, William E. Gladstone, Samuel Clemens (better known as Mark Twain), and the Rev. C. L. Dodgson (with the equally prominent pen name Lewis Carroll). The roster also listed Arthur Balfour, a future prime minister of England, and William James, a pioneer in psychology, who by the summer of 1894 had been named the society&#x2019;s president. <br>It was Lodge&#x2019;s inquisitiveness, not a belief in ghosts, that first drove him to become a member of the SPR. The occult was for him just one more invisible realm worthy of exploration, the outermost province of the emerging science of psychology. The unveiling during Lodge&#x2019;s life of so many hitherto unimagined physical phenomena, among them Heinrich Hertz&#x2019;s discovery of electromagnetic waves, suggested to him that the world of the mind must harbor secrets of its own. The fact that waves could travel through the ether seemed to confirm the existence of another plane of reality. If one could send electromagnetic waves through the ether, was it such an outrageous next step to suppose that the spiritual essence of human beings, an electromagnetic soul, might also exist within the ether and thus explain the hauntings and spirit rappings that had become such a fixture of common legend? Reports of ghosts inhabiting country houses, poltergeists rattling abbeys, spirits knocking on tables during s�ances&#x2014;all these in the eyes of Lodge and fellow members of the society seemed as worthy of dispassionate analysis as the invisible travels of an electromagnetic wave. <br>Within a few years of his joining the SPR, however, events challenged Lodge&#x2019;s ability to maintain his scientific remove. In Boston William James began hearing from his own family about a certain &#x201c;Mrs. Piper&#x201d;&#x2014;Lenore Piper&#x2014;a medium who was gaining notoriety for possessing strange powers. Intending to expose her as a fraud, James arranged a sitting and found himself enthralled. He suggested that the society invite Mrs. Piper to England for a series of experiments. She and her two daughters sailed to Liverpool in November 1889 and then traveled to Cambridge, where a sequence of sittings took place under the close observation of SPR members. Lodge arranged a sitting of his own and suddenly found himself listening to his dead aunt Anne, a beloved woman of lively intellect who had abetted his drive to become a scientist against the wishes of his father. She once had told Lodge that after her death she would come back to visit if she could, and now, in a voice he remembered, she reminded him of that promise. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;was an unusual thing to happen.&#x201d; <br>To Lodge, the encounter seemed proof that some part of the human mind persisted even after death. It left him, he wrote, &#x201c;thoroughly convinced not only of human survival, but of the power to ...</p><h2>Nicotine: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>One of <em>Huffington Post&#x2019;s</em> 20 Fall 2016 Books You&#x2019;ll Need for Your Bookshelf</strong></p><p><strong>Featured in <em>New York</em> Magazine&#x2019;s Fall 2016 Preview</strong></p><p><strong>One of <em>Slate's </em>Best Books of 2016</strong></p><p><strong>An <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> Fall 2016 Must-Read</strong></p><p><strong>Featured in <em>LitHub&#x2019;s</em> 2016 Bookseller&#x2019;s Fall Preview</strong></p><p><strong>Featured in <em>The Guardian</em> Fall 2016 Books Preview: The Best American Writing</strong></p><p>From the &#x201c;wonderfully talented&#x201d; (Dwight Garner, <em>New York Times</em>) author of <em>Mislaid</em> and <em>The Wallcreeper</em> comes a fierce and audaciously funny new novel, dazzling in its energy and ambition: a story of obsession, idealism, and ownership, centered around a young woman who inherits her bohemian father&#x2019;s childhood home.</p><p>&nbsp;Recent business school graduate Penny Baker has rebelled against her family her whole life-by being the conventional one.

Most recently, Richard founded the Imagine This! Company, an organization that is developing television, educational curricula, and home based games and activities based on using storytelling as a tool to enhance the literacy and imaginative skills of children ages 8 to 15.Storytelling is not merely an art, Stone argues; it is a lifeline to understanding, both between persons and within an individual psyche. Stone is passionate about storytelling and its possibilities for human healing, and he carries us along with that fervor. Our culture, he contends, currently suffers from "destorification," a process parallel to desertification (the slow drying up of previously fertile land), in which our lives are slowly losing vividness and meaning, while banal or vulgar sit-coms and worse stand in for the stories we have lost. Stone's book is not merely a jeremiad, however; it also offers a series of exercises to help individuals reclaim and polish the stories our real lives are waiting for us to tell. Not just for storytellers, this may prove an excellent resource for teachers, seniors, and spiritual seekers, too. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Helpmates, Harlots, and Heroes: Women&#39;s Stories in the Hebrew Bible</h2><p>This book focuses on biblical stories about women, collected in one volume, paraphrases and interprets them from multiple and diverse scholars and in addition highlights the benefits and problems of the stories for contempory women.</p><p><b>Alice Ogden Bellis</b> is Professor of Old Testament Language and Literature at the Howard University School of Divinity in Washington, D.C.

And she shows how both the symbolic and the literal search for roots becomes a crucial part of the journey toward wholeness.</p><p><b>Betty Jean Lifton, Ph.D.,</b> has done extensive research and counseling with all members of the adoption triad. She is the author of several books on adoption, including <i>Twice Born: Memoirs of an adopted Daughter</i> and <i>Lost and Found: The Adoption Experience,</i> as well as a young adult novel, <i>I'm Still Me,</i> and a children's book, <i>Tell Me a Real Adoption Story.</i> She is also the author of <i>The King of Children: A Biography of Janusz Korczak </i>and <i>A Place Called Hiroshima.</i>An useful though biased and histrionic account of the adopted person's struggle to form ``an authentic sense of self.'' Lifton (Lost and Found, 1979; Twice Born, 1975) continues to explore the struggles and journeys of adopted people. When she was seven, Lifton was informed by her mother that she was adopted. ``I was not to share it with anyone--not even my father. It would break his heart if he suspected I knew.'' Lifton projects her own sense of trauma onto all adoptees. Anecdotes and statistics supplement her thesis that all adoptees are emotionally scarred, doomed to a lifelong ``quest for wholeness.'' Even when discussing international and biracial adoptions, in which everything is out in the open, Lifton focuses only on the negative, despite the great number of successful adoptions that have been documented. She dismisses any adoptee, birth mother, or adoptive parent who disputes her thesis as being ``in denial,'' arguing that an adoptee can best be healed through a reunion with his or her birth parents. But too many of the reunions recounted here weaken her thesis that ``the very idea of search is empowering, no matter what the outcome.'' For instance, in a chapter entitled ``The Mark of Oedipus,'' Lifton reports on some reunions that lapsed into incestuous relationships. Lifton too glibly portrays adoptive parents as insecure, overprotective, traumatized by their infertility, and threatened by their child's search for birth parents. Her opposition to adoptions cloaked in secrecy is valid (though she's hardly alone in that view). But her ascribing of all an adoptee's insecurities and emotional difficulties to the fact of having been adopted--rather than to the human condition--is simple reductionism. Lifton provides valuable resources for adoptees, birth parents, and adoptive parents. Ultimately, though, the book is imbalanced and unconvincing, despite its passion. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

April 1933.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gingerbread? You&#x2019;re sure it was gingerbread she asked for, Gracie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The odd request was the very last thing a housekeeper wanted to hear at this moment. Mrs. Bolton stood in the centre of the heaving kitchen overseeing her troops with a discipline firm enough to have impressed the Duke of Wellington himself. But, ever alert, the Iron Duke would, like her, have had his attention snagged by an unexpected detail.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t run!&#x201d; Mrs. Bolton swept a teetering pile of dirty dishes from the hands of an exhausted fourteen-year-old kitchen maid, straightened them, waited until the girl was steady on her feet again and then handed them back. &#x201c;Put these in the sink and go upstairs to bed, there&#x2019;s a good girl. You&#x2019;ve done well tonight, Elsie.&#x201d; She turned her attention back to her ladyship&#x2019;s maid. &#x201c;Now,&nbsp; Grace. You see how we&#x2019;re fixed. It&#x2019;s half past eleven. Twelve sat down to dinner. Twelve have to be cleared up after. That&#x2019;s before we start setting for breakfast. And you come swanning in here telling me her ladyship wants gingerbread served with her bedtime cocoa?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two women exchanged glances. They were getting dangerously near to implying criticism of the mistress. The other servants were bustling a little less noisily. Mrs. Bolton sensed that ears were being cocked in her direction and she finished diplomatically: &#x201c;You must have misheard, Gracie. She doesn&#x2019;t eat gingerbread. Take her a slice of nice plain Victoria sponge if she&#x2019;s still hungry. Can&#x2019;t see why she would be&#x2014;she cleared her plates as usual and had a second helping of Pavlova pudding.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;No, no, Mrs. Bolton. She was very particular. Just tell me if you&#x2019;ve got gingerbread in the pantry and I&#x2019;ll do the tray myself. I won&#x2019;t get in your way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Bolton led her over to the larder. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure then. But I warn you&#x2014;the mistress can&#x2019;t abide anything spicy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah . . . women can change their minds sometimes, you know. And their fancies,&#x201d; Grace confided. &#x201c;For undisclosed reasons.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, ho! So that&#x2019;s how it is!&#x201d; Rolling eyes and a quick intake of breath indicated that enlightenment had struck the housekeeper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true then, the murmurings I&#x2019;ve heard? Well I never! You and she have kept that one dark, Gracie! I doubt even the master knows his good news. Is that so?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Shh! I&#x2019;ve no idea what you&#x2019;re on about Mrs. B. We don&#x2019;t want to spread silly rumours do we? Now if you&#x2019;ll&nbsp; . . . ?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find some in the Jubilee biscuit tin behind the pantry door. I keep it for the servants&#x2019; tea. It&#x2019;s a bit stale, but if I&#x2019;m guessing right and this is by way of being a craving, she probably won&#x2019;t notice. I&#x2019;ve known fancies for stranger things than stale gingerbread at midnight. Oh, and by the way . . .&#x201d; Mrs. Bolton wiped all expression from her face as she added, &#x201c;Bearing all in mind . . . she might like to hear that the master has retired to the snooker room with Master Alexander and the other gentlemen and two bottles of his best Napoleon brandy. It looks like being a long session. She should have an untroubled evening.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just for once, she&#x2019;ll be glad of that,&#x201d; Grace replied,&nbsp; winking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housekeeper smiled. Grace Aldred was always quick on the uptake and discreet with it. The very best lady&#x2019;s maid you could hope for. Mrs. Bolton thanked her lucky stars for Gracie, who covered as best she could for the inadequacies of a not universally popular mistress. Her ladyship couldn&#x2019;t always&#x2014;in fact, couldn&#x2019;t often&#x2014;be depended on to make good decisions, but in this case she&#x2019;d done the right thing in offering the delicate and demanding post to what you might call a &#x201c;home-grown&#x201d; girl off the estate. Not like the personal attendants the lady guests had brought with them for this house party weekend. A heap of trouble they were! Demanding fusspots, hating each other, hating being cooped up together in the country in unseasonably Arctic conditions. Unlike their ladies who, for the most part, were as good as gold and content to gossip in corners over their embroidery. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for the fifth female guest. The one who&#x2019;d arrived late. She&#x2019;d turned up by taxi all the way from Cambridge, if you please. Gadding about the country like some Zuleika Dobson! Who on earth was she? No one seemed to know. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No friend of the <i>mistress</i>, that little Miss Mystery,&#x201d; the footman had reported knowingly when called on to shed some light on the problem at the end of dinner. Leaning close to ladle out the soup, the footmen were always the first to assess relationships and get a breath of scandal. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong about that, Mrs. Bolton. At each other&#x2019;s throats through the last four courses, they were! All her ladyship&#x2019;s fault&#x2014;you know what she&#x2019;s like. Did her best to bomb the poor little person out of her trench. But when she finally managed it between the sole and the cutlets, she wished she hadn&#x2019;t! Got as good as she gave! Better! But watch out&#x2014;you wouldn&#x2019;t want to get caught between those two. Trouble! With a bit of luck, the lassie will pack her traps and buzz off back to Cambridge before we get to the hair-tugging and eye-scratching.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A puzzle. A young, unrelated, single girl of undeniable attractions could not possibly be here as a guest of the master, and yet she appeared to be at daggers drawn with the mistress. Most unusually, the young woman had turned up unaccompanied by male escort or lady&#x2019;s maid. When Mrs. Bolton had offered the services of young Rosie to do the necessary, she&#x2019;d declined them. Oh, politely enough&#x2014;there was nothing wrong with her manners&#x2014;but had there been a touch of supercilious indulgence in her tone as she&#x2019;d added, &#x201c;I can tie my own shoelaces and brush my own hair, thank you&#x201d;? She&#x2019;d shaken her over-short London haircut and laughed. Mrs. Bolton marked her down as something of a renegade. One of those Bright Young Things. Even the Bloomsbury set when they visited&#x2014;and they were odd enough&#x2014;at least brought their maids with them. Maids! <i>Their</i> girls were not required to wear cap and apron, and expected to be called by their Christian names. And those would be borrowed from some Greek goddess, like as not. All that nonsense set a bad enough example, but this latest guest, trailing an atmosphere of unease and defiance in her wake, looked even more disruptive, Mrs. Bolton calculated. A Modern Miss. Independent. Might even be a Socialist. She&#x2019;d bear watching.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enid Bolton sighed. Three French maids, two warring women and one bemused housekeeper to keep the peace. Tin hats on, she reckoned, should be the order of the day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you get it? You did? Good girl! Let me see.&#x201d; The voice was bubbling with eagerness and laughter. Grace&#x2019;s mistress, sitting in silken pyjamas at her dressing table, put down her hairbrush and examined the contents of the supper tray. She tilted her nose in exaggerated scorn at the square of brown, spongey cake. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s gingerbread. Are you supposed to eat it or bathe with it? I&#x2019;ll take the cocoa, thank you, but this offering you can put over there on the table by the window. That shall be our laboratory, our home pharmacy. I want you to do the mixing&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t be doing with the stinks. Spices always make me sneeze. Now, let&#x2019;s check we have all the ingredients.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace unlocked a drawer of the bureau and took out four small blue packets bearing the label of the local pharmacy. Her mistress took a crumpled scrap of paper from her jewel box, smoothed it flat and, putting on a country accent, read out the four items scrawled on it. The affected voice was meant to convey the roughness of the handwriting done in indelible pencil: &#x201c;Rose Mary, Finnigrig, Sinnimun, Oil of Cummin.&#x201d; She handed it to Grace for inspection.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;All present and correct, ma&#x2019;am, though the chemist spelled some of them differently,&#x201d; Grace commented and put it away in her pocket.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right-oh. Now you have to mix them all into a paste and spread it over the piece of cake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But they&#x2019;re mostly powders, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Grace said, peering into the packets. &#x201c;How&#x2019;m I supposed to make a paste?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t be such a weed! Think of something!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace looked about her. &#x201c;Your cocoa, ma&#x2019;am? If there&#x2019;s a drop left in the bottom of the cup . . . It&#x2019;ll add to the flavour.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course! Here, take it. Why don&#x2019;t you combine all the ingredients in the cup? There, that&#x2019;s the way. Urgh! How simply ghastly!&#x201d; Her ladyship held a handkerchief to her nose. &#x201c;What was that you just put in?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be the cumin. Smells worse than a pigman&#x2019;s old socks. This fenugreek isn&#x2019;t much better. Took me ages to get it out of the chemist. Old Morrison pretended not to know what I was on about when I asked for &#x2018;finnigrig&#x2019; as it says on your list. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a mite special,&#x2019; he says, &#x2018;and not for putting about the place.&#x2019; And what did I need it for anyway? he wanted to know. He&#x2019;s a suspicious old cove! I told him cook had requested it to make a curry. Indian gentleman expected at the house next week. That shut him up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You think of everything, Grace. Now mix it all up.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Anything else you&#x2019;d like me to slip in there while I&#x2019;m at it? &#x2018;Eye of newt? Toe of bat?&nbsp; Adder&#x2019;s fork?&#x2019; . . . How does it go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was greeted with a shriek of laughter. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;toe of frog,&#x2019; I think you&#x2019;ll find. And, no, I shan&#x2019;t be needing any of that rubbish. Not when I&#x2019;m in possession of <i>bone of toad</i>! That&#x2019;s the real stuff! Here, Grace, I want you to stir the mixture with this. Careful now! It&#x2019;s precious! I&#x2019;m not sure how strong it is. It looks a bit ancient to me. And I&#x2019;ve sworn to give it back to its owner again in one piece.&#x201d; She took from amongst the silver toiletry implements on her dressing table tray a three-inch-long piece of bone, the colour of old ivory and forked like a chicken&#x2019;s wishbone. She handed it to her maid, who took it with a shudder of distaste and stirred the mixture gently with it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now, set the bone to one side to dry out and check in the morning that I&#x2019;ve got it safely hidden away in my left pocket. It has to be the left because that&#x2019;s the side the Devil favours or some such rot. The bone&#x2019;s the important bit of the magic. Absolutely crucial! Nothing works without it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace dropped it onto the supper tray, turned her back on her mistress and made the sign of the cross over her chest. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t much care for the feel of that old toad bone in my hand, madam. Cold and soapy. It fair gave me the creeps.&#x201d; Her voice was pitched unnaturally high with the strain of daring to disagree with her mistress. &#x201c;Not sure we ought to be fiddling about with magic. It could all turn nasty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nonsense! <i>Untested</i> magic I would have no truck with, but I&#x2019;ve seen this work with my own eyes. Magic? It&#x2019;s practically science! I have my information and instruction from the very best practitioner. Neither of us must breathe a word, though, or we&#x2019;ll have the clod-hopping peasantry of this whole benighted county vowing vengeance. Mum&#x2019;s the word, Grace!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace bit her lip and bobbed to show her understanding. Her city-bred mistress forgot&#x2014;or didn&#x2019;t care&#x2014;that her maid was of Suffolk stock herself. She tinkered about for a few minutes more, the homely activity of spreading and slicing the gingerbread calming her. She began rather to enjoy herself, like a child at a dollies&#x2019; tea party. &#x201c;There, that&#x2019;s all done. It&#x2019;s neat and in a hand-sized lump, but it&#x2019;s a bit sticky. I&#x2019;ll put it into one of these empty chemist&#x2019;s bags so it won&#x2019;t spoil the inside of your pocket.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you, my dear. Put it away in the closet for the night, will you, and spray my pillows with rosewater. Then you may retire. It&#x2019;s almost midnight! Leave the door unlocked so that you can come straight in without knocking in the morning. We don&#x2019;t want to wake the whole house. Just be sure to wake me well before dawn.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Night-time showers had left the ground sodden, and Grace was glad she&#x2019;d had the forethought to search out a pair of gumboots in her mistress&#x2019;s size in view of her destination. It was quite a hike down to the Home Farm, and at crack of dawn on a misty April morning, the stables were likely to be a bit nasty underfoot. The wind had turned at last, sending rainclouds racing away in tatters, and a slash of pink on the eastern horizon promised a fine fresh morning. In the darkness, Grace could only just make out her ladyship, but she could hear her clearly enough and cringed as she heard her hailing the two stable-boy escorts in her hunting-field voice. She was wearing a sensible riding outfit over which she&#x2019;d flung a baggy waterproof cape with two large pockets.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lads, blinking and bleary, answered up shyly, assuring her that all was ready. She turned with a triumphant smile, patted each pocket in a pantomime of exaggerated care for Grace&#x2019;s benefit and gave a playful farewell flourish of her riding crop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grace, from the back doorstep, watched her mistress march off into the morning mist to perform her magic. The maid&#x2019;s body twitched as training did battle with instinct; dutiful obedience helped her to fight back an almost uncontrollable urge to chase afte...</p><h2>Walking the Gobi: 1,600 Mile-trek Across a Desert of Hope and Despair</h2><p><br><br>* The ultimate Baby Boomer adventure story!<br><br>* The author is an icon among American women adventurers<br><br>* By the bestselling author of<i> Polar Dream</i><br>At the age of 63, Helen Thayer fulfilled her lifelong dream of crossing Mongolia's Gobi Desert.

But for more than three decades, the secrets behind the Beatles' unparalleled artistic evolution were beyond reach--sealed in a locked room at London's Abbey Road Studios.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this comprehensive and brilliantly rendered book the only "outsider" to gain access to these invaluable musical archives provides a new, fascinating look at the music and artistry of the Beatles, revealing how four untrained musicians merged their collective genius into a single creative force, how they came together to paint pictures with sound...and how album by album, the Beatles transformed the landscape of popular music forever.<br><br>Combining literary analysis and investigative reporting with page-turning storytelling and musical explication, author Mark Hertsgaard has written the first serious biography of the music of the Beatles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Day in the Life </i>takes readers inside the Beatles' creative process as never before, from the first tentative run-throughs in the studio of such classics as "Eleanor Rigby" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to the final master tapes.<br><br>Here we learn how George Harrison's stirring composition "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was completely transformed from an achingly meditative acoustic masterpiece to a hard-rocking hit--in forty-four takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We recall how the fantastic final mix of "Strawberry Fields Forever" opens the door to a psychedelic utopia, but discover it is the haunting solo version that takes us down to the core of John Lennon's disillusioned soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;And only here do we see how the Beatles' audacious ability to reinvent themselves stamped the group's unfolding ingenuity on each album like a fingerprint.<br><br>With rare insight, Mark Hertsgaard unlocks the mystery of the century's most dynamic musical collaboration: the competitive and creative partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Day in the Life </i>traces the way Lennon and McCartney worked together and paints an intricate picture of the composers as we have never seen them before: Paul, the optimistic foil who made John's ominous fragments whole...John, the natural poet who injected raw sexuality into "I Saw Her Standing There" by making a simple five word change.<br><br>Smart, fresh, compulsively readable, <i>A Day in the Life </i>reveals John, Paul, George, and Ringo not as celebrities or cultural icons but as musicians whose work will be remembered as some of the most important art of the twentieth century.</p><p><p>"A hundred years from now, people will listen to the music of the Beatles the way we listen to Mozart." --Paul McCartney</p><p>"Just say whatever it is that comes into your head each time--'attracts me like a...cauliflower'--until you get the word." --John Lennon, helping George Harrison compose the words to "Something"</p><p>"Everybody else thought they were for the teenyboppers, that they were gonna pass right away. But it was obvious to me they had staying power. I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go." --Bob Dylan</p>Somewhere inside London's Abbey Road studios, hidden behind an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door, are some of the most valuable artifacts of twentieth-century music: the raw tapes of every recording session in the nearly eight-year studio career of the Beatles.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most remarkable facts about the Beatles is that they released only ten and a half hours of music during their years together--the contents of the group's twenty-two singles and fourteen albums.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the tapes inside the Abbey Road archives, it turns out, contain more than four hundred hours' worth of Beatles recordings.<br><br>The collection extends from June 6, 1962, the date of the audition that narrowly persuaded George Martin, a producer at EMI Records, to sign the Beatles, to January 4, 1970, when Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr (John Lennon was in Denmark on holiday) recorded the final overdubs for what amounted to the group's farewell album, <i>Let It Be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>In between are tapes of everything else, stored in red-and-white cardboard boxes the size of large telephone books.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick a favorite Beatles song; the archives hold not only the master tape of that song as it is heard on the album but also the working tapes that trace the song's evolution from its first run-through to its polished final version.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also lots of off-the-cuff jam sessions, arguments, horseplay and studio chat, as well as a few songs the general public has never heard.<br><br>In the course of the research for this book, I was fortunate enough to gain access to these archives on two occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;While on assignment for <i>The New Yorker</i>, I spent the equivalent of six full days inside Abbey Road, listening to fifty hours of tapes of the Beatles and of the solo work of John Lennon.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes felt during those days as though I had been allowed to watch Picasso sketch, and never more so than on the afternoon I listened to all seven takes of "A Day In The Life," the closing song on the <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band </i>album.<br><br>John Lennon recalled <i>Sgt. Pepper </i>as "a peak" in the Beatles' career, a time when "Paul and I were definitely working together, especially on 'A Day in the Life.' " Indeed, "A Day In The Life" may be the ultimate McCartney-Lennon collaboration, a classic example of how the songwriting style of each man perfectly complemented that of the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although John would later confess that he and Paul wrote many songs "eyeball to eyeball," especially in the early days, their usual practice by this time, January 1967, was for one of them to provide the missing middle or accents to a song that the other had already almost completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of "A Day In The Life," it was Paul who made John's composition whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon had the melody and story line--the man who "blew his mind out in a car," the English Army that "had just won the war," the "four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire"--but the song needed something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon didn't like laboring over songs, preferring instead the Zen purity of inspiration, so when he got stuck after completing the main verses he set the song aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I needed a middle-eight for it [the "middle eight" is the middle of a song where the tune changes before going back to the original verse], but that would have been forcing it," he later explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the rest had come out smooth, flowing, no trouble, and to write a middle eight would have been to write a middle eight, but Paul already had one there."<br><br>Paul did indeed have the fragment "Woke up, fell out of bed..." lying around. The two partners agreed that its peppy portrait of the modern urban life--based on Paul's memories of rushing to school in the morning--made the ideal counterpoint to John's gently ominous, dreamlike commentary on the hollow absurdity of status, order, and worldly attachments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial idea for the song had come, as it so often did with Lennon, from an item in the mass media. "I was reading the paper one day and noticed two stories," he recalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;"One was about the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the main headline story.&nbsp;&nbsp;He died in London in a car crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next page was a story about four thousand potholes in the streets of Blackburn, Lancashire, that needed to be filled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul's contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song, 'I'd love to turn you on,' that he'd had floating around in his head and couldn't use.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a damn good piece of work."<br><br>The Guinness heir, whom the Beatles had happened to know, was born to a life of fantastic privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;By conventional standards he was "a lucky man who made the grade." He had everything money could buy, but found himself no more immune to death's arbitrary, dispassionate arrival than the lowliest proletarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;A momentary, all too human lapse--"he didn't notice that the lights had changed"--and he was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of death, all delusion is shattered, everyone is equal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon clinches the point with the wistful, mocking epitaph "Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords." The gathered crowd knows they've "seen his face before" but they can't place it; in the broad scheme of things, he is barely a bit player.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth and position that seemed so important, to the heir <i>and </i>the larger society, is revealed as trivial and fleeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally blinded by a different kind of triviality are the bureaucrats of the final verse, who insist on tabulating the precise number of holes in the roads of Blackburn, Lancashire, even "though the holes were rather small." No wonder the singer would "love to turn you on." To see his fellow human beings sleepwalking so numbly through the glorious richness that life offers is heartbreaking.<br><br>Musicologist Wilfrid Mellers has observed that "A Day In The Life" derives much of its power from the contrast between its relatively simple tune and the horrors described in its lyrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is Lennon's <i>voice </i>as much as anything that puts the message across.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1992 behind-the-scenes documentary <i>The Making of Sgt Pepper, </i>George Martin played an early version of "A Day in the Life." Referring to John, Martin said, "even in this early take, he has a voice which sends shivers down the spine." Martin had just heard Lennon's entranced delivery of the opening lines--"I read the news today, oh boy / About a lucky man who made the grade"--and the deep gaze on his face and the slight glistening in his eyes suggested how moved he still was by the the death of his friend.</p><h2>500 Cocktails: The Only Cocktail Compendium You&#39;ll Ever Need (500 Series Cookbooks)</h2><p>500 Cocktails is a comprehensive volume that will inspire even the most reluctant host to play bartender.

A brilliant work of dark fantasy inspired by Browning&#39;s romantic poem, &#34;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&#34;.</p><p>Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, and their children in Bangor, Maine.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><p><b>The Door</b></p><p><b>1</b></p><p>Three. This is the number of your fate.</p><p>Three?</p><p>Yes, three is mystic. Three stands at the heart of the mantra.</p><p>Which three?</p><p>The first is dark-haired. He stands on the brink of robbery and murder. A demon has infested him. The name of the demon is HEROIN.</p><p>Which demon is that? I know it not, even from nursery stories.</p><p>He tried to speak but his voice was gone, the voice of the oracle, Star-Slut, Whore of the Winds, both were gone; he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere, turning and turning in the lazy dark. On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair; its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young man's neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh. Looking more closely, the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching, strangling hands. The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror.</p><p>The Prisoner, the man in black (who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted, a man named Walter) whispered chummily. A trifle upsetting, isn't he? A trifle upsetting ... a trifle upsetting ... a trifle-</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The gunslinger snapped awake, waving at something with his mutilated hand, sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him, desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull.</p><p>Instead a sea-bird, attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt, wheeled away with a frightened squawk.</p><p>Roland sat up.</p><p>His hand throbbed wretchedly, endlessly. His right foot did the same. Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there. The bottom half of his shirt was gone; what was left resembled a ragged vest. He had used one piece to bind his hand, the other to bind his foot.</p><p>Go away, he told the absent parts of his body. You are ghosts now. Go away.</p><p>It helped a little. Not much, but a little. They were ghosts, all right, but lively ghosts.</p><p>The gunslinger ate jerky. His mouth wanted it little, his stomach less, but he insisted. When it was inside him, he felt a little stronger. There was not much left, though; he was nearly up against it.</p><p>Yet things needed to be done.</p><p>He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about. Birds swooped and dived, but the world seemed to belong to only him and them. The monstrosities were gone. Perhaps they were nocturnal; perhaps tidal. At the moment it seemed to make no difference.</p><p>The sea was enormous, meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine. For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation. He had never seen such a body of water. Had heard of it in children's stories, of course, had even been assured by his teachers-some, at least-that it existed-but to actually see it, this immensity, this amazement of water after years of arid land, was difficult to accept ... difficult to even see.</p><p>He looked at it for a long time, enrapt, making himself see it, temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder.</p><p>But it was morning, and there were still things to be done.</p><p>He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket, careful to lead with the palm of his right hand, not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there, changing that hand's ceaseless sobbing to screams.</p><p>It was.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Next.</p><p>He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock. He removed the guns, swung the chambers out, and removed the useless shells. He threw them away. A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them, picked it up in its beak, then dropped it and flew away.</p><p>The guns themselves must be tended to, should have been tended to before this, but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition, he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather.</p><p>Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips; from that point they seemed dry. He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts. His right hand kept trying to do this job, insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain, and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again, like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel. In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice.</p><p>I see serious problems ahead, he thought again.</p><p>He put these shells, hopefully still good, in a pile that was dishearteningly small. Twenty. Of those, a few would almost certainly misfire. He could depend on none of them. He removed the rest and put them in another pile. Thirty-seven.</p><p>Well, you weren't heavy loaded, anyway, he thought, but he recognized the difference between fifty-seven live rounds and what might be twenty. Or ten. Or five. Or one. Or none.</p><p>He put the dubious shells in a second pile.</p><p>He still had his purse. That was one thing. He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning. By the time he was finished, two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it; conscious thought had become difficult. He wanted to sleep. He had never wanted that more in his life. But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial.</p><p>"Cort," he said in a voice that he couldn't recognize, and laughed dryly.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry. When the job was done, he held the one made for his left hand, cocked it ... and then slowly lowered the hammer again. He wanted to know, yes. Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks. But a click would mean nothing, and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen ... or nine ... or three ... or none.</p><p>He tore away another piece of his shirt, put the other shells-the ones which had been wetted-in it, and tied it, using his left hand and his teeth. He put them in his purse.</p><p>Sleep, his body demanded. Sleep, you must sleep, now, before dark, there's nothing left, you're used up- He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand. It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing, littered with sea-shells which had no color. Here and there large rocks protruded from the gross-grained sand, and these were covered with guano, the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth, the fresher splotches white.</p><p>The high-tide line was marked with drying kelp. He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line. He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadn't been washed out to sea by high-surging waves. Walking slowly, limping exquisitely, the gunslinger made his way to where they were. He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear. The other was empty. This one still had a little water left in it. Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two, but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which. He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long, long time. Water sloshed inside. That was good-a gift. Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw, but none had and the tide had spared it. Of the creature itself there was no sign, although the two of them had finished far above the tide-line. Perhaps other predators had taken it; perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea, as the elaphaunts, giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories, were reputed to bury their own dead.</p><p>He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow, drank deeply, and felt some strength come back into him. The right boot was of course ruined ... but then he felt a spark of hope. The foot itself was intact-scarred but intact-and it might be possible to cut the other down to match it, to make something which would last at least awhile.... Faintness stole over him. He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down, stupidly biting his tongue.</p><p>You won't fall unconscious, he told himself grimly. Not here, not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job.</p><p>So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist, but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again, half-fainting. He lay there awhile, one cheek pressed against the sand, the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood. He managed to drink from the waterskin, and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened. There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slope-it was stunted, but it would offer at least some shade.</p><p>To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles.</p><p>Nonetheless, he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade. He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him.</p><p>The palm of his hand was a dull red. Not a good sign.</p><p>I jerk off left-handed, he thought, at least that's something.</p><p>Then darkness took him, and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east. Morning was on its way. He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him.</p><p>He bent his head and waited.</p><p>When the faintness had passed, he looked at his hand. It was infected, all right-a tell-tale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist. It stopped there, but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines, which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him. He felt hot, feverish.</p><p>I need medicine, he thought. But there is no medicine here.</p><p>Had he come this far just to die, then? He would not. And if he were to die in spite of his determination, he would die on his way to the Tower.</p><p>How remarkable you are, gunslinger! the man in black tittered inside his head. How indomitable! How romantic in your stupid obsession!</p><p>"Fuck you," he croaked, and drank. Not much water left, either. There was a whole sea in front of him, for all the good it could do him; water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. Never mind.</p><p>He buckled on his gunbelts, tied them-this was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the day's actual prologue-and then tried to stand up. He was not convinced he could do it until it was done.</p><p>Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand, he scooped up the not-quite-empty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder. Then his purse. When he straightened, the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down, waiting, willing.</p><p>The faintness passed.</p><p>Walking with the weaving, wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness, the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand. He stood, looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine, and then took the last of his jerky from his purse. He ate half, and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly. He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had died-first seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks, then rising above them.</p><p>Roland held his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. He ate the rest of his jerky.</p><p>He thought: Very well. I am now a man with no food, with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with; I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire; I am sickening from a monster's bite and have no medicine; I have a day's water if I'm lucky; I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity. I am, in short, a man on the edge of everything.</p><p>Which way should he walk? He had come from the east; he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior. That left north and south.</p><p>North.</p><p>That was the answer his heart told. There was no question in it.</p><p>North.</p><p>The gunslinger began to walk.</p><p><b>4</b></p><p>He walked for three hours. He fell twice, and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again. Then a wave came toward him, close enough to make him remember his guns, and he was up before he knew it, standing on legs that quivered like stilts.</p><p>He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours. Now the sun was growing hot, but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face; nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him, making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter.</p><p>Fever, gunslinger, the man in black tittered. What's left inside you has been touched afire.</p><p>The red lines of infection were more pronounced now; they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow.</p><p>He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry. He tied it around his waist with the other. The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing. The sea to his right, the mountains to his left, the gray, shell-littered sand under the feet of his cut-down boots. The waves came and went. He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none. He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending.</p><p>Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up. This was the place, then. Here. This was the end, after all.</p><p>On his hands and knees, he raised his head like a groggy fighter ... and some distance ahead, perhaps a mile, perhaps three (it was difficult to judge distances along the unchanging reach of the strand with the fever working inside him, making his eyeballs pulse in and out), he saw something new. Something which stood upright on the beach.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>(three)</p><p>Didn't matter.</p><p>(three is the number of your fate)</p><p>The gunslinger managed to get to his feet again. He croaked something, some plea which only the circling seabirds heard (and how happy they would be to gobble my eyes from my head, he thought, how happy to have such a tasty bit!), and walked on, weaving more seriously now, leaving tracks behind him that were weird loops and swoops.</p><p>He kept his eyes on whatever it was that stood on the strand ahead. When his hair fell in his eyes he brushed it aside. It seemed to grow no closer. The sun reached the roof of the sky, where it seemed to remain far too long. Roland imagined he was in the d...</p></p><h2>The Grammar of Faith</h2><p>The book is acceptable condition.</p><p></p><h2>Donkey Kong Country Returns: Prima Official Game Guide</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;All levels detailed with labeled maps. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Two player tips for getting the most out of co-op play! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Every hidden item revealed.</p><p></p><h2>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II: The Fatal Errors That Led to Nazi Defeat</h2><p>Most of us rally around the glory of the Allies' victory over the Nazis in World War II. The story is often told of how the good fight was won by an astonishing array of manpower and stunning tactics. However, what is often overlooked is how the intersection between Adolf Hitler's influential personality and his military strategy was critical in causing Germany to lose the war.<br><br>With an acute eye for detail and his use of clear prose, acclaimed military historian Bevin Alexander goes beyond counterfactual "What if?" history and explores for the first time just how close the Allies were to losing the war. Using beautifully detailed, newly designed maps, <i>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; exquisitely illustrates the&nbsp;&nbsp;important battles and how certain key movements and mistakes by Germany were crucial in determining the war's outcome. Alexander's harrowing study shows how only minor tactical changes in Hitler's military approach could have changed the world we live in today. <br><br><i>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</i> untangles some of the war's most confounding strategic questions, such as: <br>Why didn't the Nazis concentrate their enormous military power on the only three beaches upon which the Allies could launch their attack into Europe? <br>Why did the terrifying German panzers, on the brink of driving the British army into the sea in May 1940, halt their advance and allow the British to regroup and evacuate at Dunkirk?<br>With the chance to cut off the Soviet lifeline of oil, and therefore any hope of Allied victory from the east, why did Hitler insist on dividing and weakening his army, which ultimately led to the horrible battle of Stalingrad?<br><br>Ultimately, Alexander probes deeply into the crucial intersection between Hitler's psyche and military strategy and how his paranoia fatally overwhelmed his acute political shrewdness to answer the most terrifying question: Just how close were the Nazis to victory? <br><br>Why did Hitler insist on terror bombing London in the late summer of 1940, when the German air force was on the verge of destroying all of the RAF sector stations, England's last defense?<br><br>With the opportunity to drive the British out of Egypt and the Suez Canal and occupy all of the Middle East, therefore opening a Nazi door to the vast oil resources of the region, why did Hitler fail to move in just a few panzer divisions to handle such an easy but crucial maneuver?<br><br>On the verge of a last monumental effort and concentration of German power to seize Moscow and end Stalin's grip over the Eastern front, why did the Nazis divert their strength to bring about the far less important surrender of Kiev, thereby destroying any chance of ever conquering the Soviets?</p><p>Adolf Hitler rose to political prominence by quickly identifying his opponents' weaknesses and turning them to his advantage. As a military leader, however, he rarely exercised the same talent for exploiting weak spots. Instead, he threw the bulk of his armies against his enemies' strongest positions, sacrificing much-needed forces at Stalingrad and Tobruk, among other places.<p> Had he done otherwise, writes Bevin Alexander, Hitler might well have carried the day. His strategy until mid-1940 had been flawless, Alexander argues: "He isolated and absorbed state after state in Europe, gained the Soviet Union as a willing ally, destroyed France's military power, threw the British off the Continent, and was left with only weak and vulnerable obstacles to an empire covering most of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East." After 1940, however, Hitler committed a legion of failures. Ignoring his field commanders' urging, he refused to commit armored divisions to seize the Suez Canal, which would have secured most of the Mediterranean and given the Third Reich easy access to oil. He diverted resources from the navy, allowing the Allies to gain control of the Atlantic Ocean and maintain nearly unbroken supply lines between the United States and Britain. And he weakened Germany's abilities to wage war by turning his armies' energies to carrying out the Final Solution. These and other miscalculations, Alexander suggests, cost the Reich many hard-won strategic advantages, and eventually any chance of victory.</p><p> Second-guessing history is an endeavor fraught with peril, and in any event, many historians have discounted the possibility that the Nazi regime could have emerged from global war undefeated. But Alexander's arguable exercise in counterfactuals soon gives way to a thoughtful, generally uncontroversial survey of the war in Europe, one that is of use to students of military history and tactics. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Bevin Alexander, an experienced military historian who writes with clarity and alarm, here presents a new and insightful interpretation of Hitler's lost opportunities to win World War II. In the process Alexander gives us a concise history of the war in Europe."<br>-- Martin Blumenson, author of The Patton Papers and Patton: The Man Behind the Legend<br><br>"In his latest book, How Hitler Could Have Won World War II, author Bevin Alexander has synthesized and analyzed the military campaigns by Germany under Hitler's control in such a readable fashion as to intrigue both armchair generals as well as serious students of military strategy and tactics. It should be a required text for study at all military schools and war colleges."<br>-- Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), former chairman, U.S. Joint chiefs of Staff<br><br>"Speculation is the handmaiden of a historian's search for a story of the past....

Various sections of the three volumes describe the arrest, interrogation, conviction, transportation, and imprisonment of the Gulag's victims by Soviet authorities over four decades. The work mingles historical exposition and Solzhenitsyn's own autobiographical accounts with the voluminous personal testimony of other inmates that he collected and committed to memory during his imprisonment.Upon publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> Solzhenitsyn was immediately attacked in the Soviet press. Despite the intense interest in his fate that was shown in the West, he was arrested and charged with treason on February 12, 1974, and was exiled from the Soviet Union the following day.</p><p><b>Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn</b> was born into a family of Cossack intellectuals in Kislovodsk, Russia, in 1918. He fought for the Soviet Union in World War II, achieving the rank of captain of artillery. In 1945 he was arrested for writing a letter in which he criticized Joseph Stalin and spent eight years in prisons and labor camps. In 1956 he was allowed to settle in Ryazan, in central Russia, where he became a mathematics teacher and began to write. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. Following the publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> he was exiled in 1974. His Soviet citizenship was restored in 1990 and he returned to Russia in 1994, where he now lives.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Encounters With Silence</h2><p>This is one of Karl Rahner&#39;s most direct and powerful books.

Son of a selfless widow, Pendennis moves from one disastrous romantic involvement to another on the fringes of the corrupt upper classes. Thackeray had slaved for ten years in this literary bohemia; the introduction considers the parallels between Thackeray's life and the novel, and examines the changes taking place in Victorian England throughout the years of the story.</p><p>Thackeray, an only child, was born in Calcutta. He studied at Cambridge, but, never a keen student, he left the University in 1830 to travel the continent. He began to study law but gave it up and squandered much of his inheritance on gambling and poor investments. He studied art in Paris, but he did not pursue that professionally either, except to illustrate his own novels.He was a successful novelist, earning the adulation of the very people he satirized.

A few people have successfully done this. As a result, they have gained access to miraculous and unused powers that mankind once had, but have lost. According to the author, this Cosmic Intelligence is limited in man due to his diminished capacity to receive and express it. This book lays out a complete program on how to regenerate the cells and gain access to this higher consciousness. This book functions as an instruction manual relating to alternative health practices, with the benefit of longer life and a higher awareness as a result. The author, Hilton Hotema, was a legendary spiritual teacher who wrote many thought-provoking books.</p></p><p>Hilton Hotema was born in Massachusetts on Feb. 7, 1878 with the original name of George R. Clements. He claimed to have become a vegan at age 9 after reading a book in school, and grew up to become a rather well-known writer and researcher on alternative health and spirituality. He lived to be 92 years of age and claimed he owed his long life to having spent most of it as a breatharian-fruitarian.</p><h2>The astrology of human relationships</h2><p>Readers learn how to use astrology to enhance personal, social, and professional relationships by understanding techniques for preparing and interpreting detailed computer-generated horoscopes.</p><p></p><h2>The Philosopher&#39;s Stone</h2><p>Howard Newman and Henry Littleway develop new mental powers while conducting psychic research, but soon find themselves the target of an unknown force</p><p>Wilson probably has earned a reputation more as a scholar and biographer than as a novelist; but this novel, originally published in 1969 and here rescued from obscurity by new-age publisher Jeremy P. Tarcher, proves that he possesses significant skills in the area of fiction as well. Wilson weaves a great deal of speculation into the meaning of human existence and the future of the species into the plot; so much so that the book at times seems as much a work of philosophy as of fiction. The story centers on the experiences of Howard Lester, an enterprising young intellectual whose work with fellow researcher Henry Littleway leads to the discovery that implanting a minute bit of a metallic alloy into the prefrontal cortex of the brain can introduce a higher state of conciousness. (As in the case with Carlos Castaneda in his thematically-similar Don Juan chronicles, the researchers later discover that the artificial catalyst is not necessary, but rather a convenient means to overcome years of conditioning). Lester and Littleway perform the operation upon themselves and proceed to refine their new skills until they are able to employ a sort of "time visioif 'that allows them to tap into racial memories. With this knowledge comes the realization that there are shadowy periods in our species' past that have been kept hidden from us by more powerful beings. Lester relates his moment of insight: "I knew with certainty that there is something in the world's prehistory that cannot be found in any of the books on the past. And it was obscurely connected with [a] sense of evil...." In the course of discovering how the Eardi-and mankind-truly evolved, this intriguing tale touches upon everything from Mayan civilization to Abraham Maslow to H.P. Lovecraft's elder Gods. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Purveyor of the occult, Wilson almost yearly produces fiction and nonfiction works that achieve popular if not critical success.

In the bohemian sixties, Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood was a hippie haven-our version of Haight-Ashbury or Greenwich Village, a place where coffeehouses like the Riverboat and the Purple Onion offered a creative mecca for musicians from across Canada. They came from Saskatoon and Winnipeg, from Vancouver and Edmonton and Halifax. By the middle of the sixties, they had forged an adventurous, original sound that the American music press proclaimed "a fresh wind from the north". It was Canadian music's first wave of international success. In researching the book, Jennings conducted more than 100 interviews with musicians, managers, club owners, booking agents, and record company executives including Gordon Lightfoot, Murray MacLauchlan, Bruce Cockburn, among many others. Many of those he's interviewed have provided the author with period photographs and other memorabilia for reproduction in this book.</p><p>Nicholas Jennings is one of Canada&#39;s most respected music journalists.

Someone needs to tuck them in! Luckily a Good Knight keeps watch and hears their lonely ROAR. The Good Knight (because he is a good knight) helps by bringing glasses of water, reading stories, singing songs, and dispensing kisses in multiple trips down his tower and through the dark forest. Young readers will fall in love with the agreeable Good Knight and the dragons with their sweet but repetitive requests. The repetition--though it tires the Good Knight--will help beginning readers build confidence. With pictures by <b>Jennifer Plecas</b>, whose unforgettably adorable dragons will win every heart, <b>Good Night, Good Knight</b> is sure to become a new bedtime classic.</p><p>Jennifer Plecas lives in Blue Springs, Missouri.PreSchool-Grade 2-Whether used as a beginning reader or as a read-aloud at bedtime, this sweet story will charm readers and listeners alike. When the Good Knight hears a "very large, very loud roar," he sets off on his faithful steed to determine its origin. Thus begins the first of four visits to a homey cave where three lonely, young dragons are delaying their bedtime. The creatures appear more precocious than ferocious with their teddy bears, bunny slippers, and patterned "jammies." Young children will immediately recognize the tactics the wide-eyed, pudgy serpents use as each request for a drink of water, a story, or a song prompts another visit from the Good Knight. On his fourth call, the youngsters explain that they can't fall asleep without a good-night kiss. The intrepid hero kisses "each scaly little cheek" and patiently waits for them to fall asleep. Only when he hears them snoring does he head back to the castle for his own peaceful night's rest. The short, simple, repetitive phrases are sure to capture the imaginations of young children. The knight stands guard at a "crumbly tumbly tower" and gallops through the forest, "Clippety-clop. Clippety-clop." Observant viewers will enjoy the expressions of the horse as he awaits his master upon each visit to the cave. With a palette dominated by the blues, grays, and purples of the nighttime setting, Plecas's illustrations are a wonderful complement to this endearing tale.<br><i>Maura Bresnahan, Shawsheen School, Andover, MA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Shaman&#39;s Apprentice: A Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest</h2><p>In a Tirio village deep in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, the shaman Nahtahlah has a place of honor in his tribe. Young Kamanya wants to learn the healing secrets of the forest plants--he hopes that he, too, will become the tribe&#x2019;s shaman, so that he can cure his people. When the villagers fall sick with an illness that Nahtahlah cannot cure, many lose faith in the shaman&#x2019;s wisdom--until a foreign woman helps them understand its value while giving Kamanya an opportunity to realize his dream. Lynne Cherry returns to the rain forest with ethnobotanist Mark J.

Her important children&#39;s books also include The Armadillo from Amarillo and two tales from the Amazon rain forest: The Great Kapok Tree and The Shaman&#39;s Apprentice. She lives in Washington, D.C.Ages 5^-9. The author of <i>The Great Kapok Tree</i> (1990) takes us back to the Amazon rain forest, this time teaming up with ethnobotanist Plotkin. Together, they present a story in which a lesson about medicinal herbs is brought to life through young Kamanya, who dreams of becoming his tribe's next shaman. Kamanya spends his time following the current shaman into the forest and learning the secrets of the plants. But local plants can't cure the new diseases brought to the area by strangers, and the pills the strangers bring with them cause the indigenous people to lose faith in the ability of their shaman. Eventually a woman named Gabriella, who comes to study the properties of the rain forest plants, restores the tribe's faith. The lush illustrations make the story a visual pleasure. Even the endpapers are rich in detail, picturing some of the rain forest plants and noting their uses. Like other books Cherry has worked on, this one, which is based on a true story, is a unusual addition to rain forest literature. It will be useful not only for story hours but also as a springboard for classroom discussion for older children as well as younger ones. <i>Helen Rosenberg</i></p><h2>Photobooth: A Biography</h2><p>For almost a century chemical photobooths have occupied public spaces; giving people the opportunity to quickly take inexpensive, quality photos.

"Ward's writing throbs with life, grief, and love... this book is the kind that makes you ache to return to it" (<i>Buzzfeed</i>). <p></p>Jojo is thirteen years old and trying to understand what it means to be a man. He doesn't lack in fathers to study, chief among them his Black grandfather, Pop. But there are other men who complicate his understanding: his absent White father, Michael, who is being released from prison; his absent White grandfather, Big Joseph, who won't acknowledge his existence; and the memories of his dead uncle, Given, who died as a teenager. <p></p>His mother, Leonie, is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister's lives. She is an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her. She is Black and her children's father is White. She wants to be a better mother but can't put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she's high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances. <p></p>When the children's father is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to the heart of Mississippi and Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. At Parchman, there is another thirteen-year-old boy, the ghost of a dead inmate who carries all of the ugly history of the South with him in his wandering. He too has something to teach Jojo about fathers and sons, about legacies, about violence, about love. <p></p>Rich with Ward's distinctive, lyrical language, <i>Sing, Unburied, Sing </i>is a majestic and unforgettable family story and "an odyssey through rural Mississippi's past and present" (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).</p><p>Jesmyn Ward received her MFA from the University of Michigan and has received the MacArthur Genius Grant, a Stegner Fellowship, a John and Renee Grisham Writers Residency, and the Strauss Living Prize.

She is currently an associate professor of creative writing at Tulane University and lives in Mississippi."Ghosts, literal and literary, haunt nearly every page of <i>Sing, Unburied, Sing </i>-- a novel whose boundaries between the living and the dead shift constantly, like smoke or sand. Set on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi (a place rich in oil rigs and atmosphere, if almost nothing else), the book's Southern gothic aura recalls the dense, head-spinning prose of William Faulkner or Flannery O'Connor. But the voice is entirely Ward's own, a voluptuous magical realism that takes root in the darkest corners of human behavior ...

A furious brew with hints of Toni Morrison and Homer's "The Odyssey," Ward's novel hits full stride when Leonie takes her children and a friend and hits the road to pick up her children's father, Michael, from prison. On a real and metaphorical road of secrets and sorrows, the story shifts narrators -- from Jojo to Leonie to Richie, a doomed boy from his grandfather's fractured past -- as they crash into both the ghosts that stalk them, as well as the disquieting ways these characters haunt themselves."<br> --<b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>"<i>Sing, Unburied, Sing</i> is many things: a road novel, a slender epic of three generations and the ghosts that haunt them, and a portrait of what ordinary folk in dire circumstances cleave to as well as what they -- and perhaps we all -- are trying to outrun."<br> --<b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"<i>Sing, Unburied Sing</i> is Ward's third novel and her most ambitious yet. Her lyrical prose takes on, alternately, the tones of a road novel and a ghost story ... <i>Sing</i>, which is longlisted for a 2017 National Book Award, establishes Ward as one of the most poetic writers in the conversation about America's unfinished business in the black South."<br> --<b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>"While the magical element is new in Ward's fiction, her allusiveness, anchored in her interest in the politics of race, has been pointing in this direction all along. It takes a touch of the spiritual to speak across chasms of age, class, and color ... The signal characteristic of Ward's prose is its lyricism. "I'm a failed poet," she has said. The length and music of Ward's sentences owe much to her love of catalogues, extended similes, imagistic fragments, and emphasis by way of repetition ... The effect, intensified by use of the present tense, can be hypnotic. Some chapters sound like fairy tales. This, and her ease with vernacular language, puts Ward in fellowship with such forebears as Zora Neale Hurston and William Faulkner."<br> --<b><i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"[A] tour de force ...

As soon as they leave the relative safety of their backwoods farm, the snares and temptations of the outside world crowd in, threatening to derail their trip or cast them into some fresh ordeal .... The plight of this one family is now tied to intersecting crimes and failings that stretch over decades. Looking out to the yard, Jojo thinks, 'The branches are full.

A huge, mysterious, cylindrical object appears in space, swooping in toward the sun. The citizens of the solar system send a ship to investigate before the enigmatic craft, called Rama, disappears. The astronauts given the task of exploring the hollow cylindrical ship are able to decipher some, but definitely not all, of the extraterrestrial vehicle's puzzles. From the ubiquitous trilateral symmetry of its structures to its cylindrical sea and machine-island, Rama's secrets are strange evidence of an advanced civilization. But who, and where, are the Ramans, and what do they want with humans? Perhaps the answer lies with the busily working biots, or the sealed-off buildings, or the inaccessible "southern" half of the enormous cylinder.

By the author of Wages of Sin. Original.</p><p>Father Greeley ( Happy Are the Meek ) not only kissed the Blarney Stone but swallowed it whole for this masterful Bishop "Blackie" Ryan whodunit. Setting it in Dublin on Bloomsday, Greeley makes James Joyce as much a part of the plot as the IRA. Beautiful and seductive Nora MacDonaugh's husband, industrialist Jim Lark MacDonaugh, was blown to bits by a bomb just a week after he changed his will in her favor. When the Dublin police discover that her first husband committed suicide and also left his money to her, Nora becomes the top suspect. Her late husband's second-in-command, Arthur T. Regan, hires ex-Chicago cop Tim MacCarthy to pin the crime on her. But MacCarthy is not convinced of her guilt; and since he is nothing if not the second-best detective in Chicago, he soon teams up with the best, Bishop Ryan, to defend Nora and find the real killer. Together, they combat the cynical Dublin police, the IRA, and the late MacDonaugh's family and business associates. MacCarthy proves as entertaining as Ryan, and the inevitable love affair between the detective and Nora is both realistic and tension-provoking. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ice Opinion: Ice T</h2><p>Hoping to inspire conversation and provocative opinions, the controversial rap artist provides his views on the ghetto, riots, success, free speech, education, art, and other important facets of life. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Los Angelino rap musician Ice-T unbuttons his shirt about ghetto life and the storm that hit when his song ``Cop Killer'' seemingly fueled a weak-minded kid to murder a cop. Ice-T defends his record label, which stood behind him, but admits that ``Warner Brothers cannot afford to be in the business of black rage.'' ``Who gives a fuck? is one of the first questions a kid will ask himself growing up in the ghetto. He'll look around at the broken-down buildings, the shabby projects, the cracked schoolyard playgrounds, and it doesn't look like anybody gives a fuck.'' Rap rolls off Ice-T's tongue like jive filled with ground glass. He affects street smarts, a this-is-the-way-it-is stance, and yet admits, ``Anything that comes out of my mouth could be totally wrong, but this is how I see the world around me.'' But isn't there something forced in his story of kids getting $250 tickets for jaywalking and parking offenses just so the cops can collect fingerprints? There are sex ploys with groupies who have a mission to score on him: ``If you are only out to fuck, do not be afraid to lie. Do not be afraid to lie.'' But this changes into T's guide to good manners: ``Men have to learn courting and mating skills. You help yourself by learning a few basics. If you can dance, that will help. Give a woman a reason to like you. Wash your ass. Do some sit-ups. And once you get your physical act together, read some books. Learn something. Be interesting. Get some flavor about yourself.'' Later: ``If you sat up around a nun long enough, she'd probably want to fuck you...You got to deal with them on a mental level, you got to deal with them on a spiritual level.'' You deal from a 150,000 first printing to even make 'em hear you. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>No stranger to the injustices perpetrated on African Americans, West Coast rapper Ice-T has made a career out of speaking his mind. One of the originators of gangsta rap, the hard-core style currently topping the charts, he possesses a bold voice whose defiance and anger pointedly express the rage of the ghetto. Ice-T was once a gangbanger specializing in jewelry heists, and he still has ties and credibility within the gang community; like his raps, these 10 lectures on the world as Ice-T sees it pull no punches. "Free speech does not really exist in America," he claims. He sees his nemesis in Tipper Gore, the vice-president's wife and founder of the Parents Media Research Center; "this crazed bitch" tried to get his recordings labeled as containing objectionable content. Later, "Cop Killer," a thrash rock song about police brutality that provoked the ire of policemen throughout the nation, helped keep him in the headlines. Although he believes he should have the right to say anything he wants, he is ultimately less an advocate of the First Amendment than an opponent of police brutality against people of color. Yet he knows what he says is not gospel and subtitles his book accordingly; for although controversy seems to dog his every step, he maintains he really wants to encourage dialogue. Among the hot topics he also airs his opinions on are street gangs, sex, rap, religion, and the L.A. riots. <i>Benjamin Segedin</i></p><h2>Captain James Cook</h2><p>Biography of Captain James Cook.</p><p>Richard Hough with his high reputation as a biographer and naval historian, is the author of many books. He wrote THE MURDER OF CAPTAIN COOK in 1979 to mark the bicentenary of the explorer&#39;s death in that year.Long before space travel and long before the proliferation of media made the world a "global village," the most dashing and courageous men in the world were such explorers as Captain James Cook. Hough's easygoing, thorough treatment of the early years of Cook's training and the later years of exploration and discovery spotlights a proud, determined man whose exploring was tightly tied to scientific speculations. Cook's meanderings introduced countless new flora and fauna and acquainted Europeans with the many cultures of the Pacific, among them the Maoris and the Hawaiians, the latter of whom dealt the explorer--literally--a death blow. (A spectacular account of Captain Cook's death at the hands of the islanders is one of the high points of the book.) Hough finishes with a flourish by suggesting that a heretofore unknown health problem may have led to the incident provoking the captain's death. The legacy of Cook, last of the great adventurers of the exploration era, is clearly indicated in his transition from exploration in search of gold and riches to modern scientific exploration. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>The Life of Langston Hughes: Volume II: 1941-1967: I Dream a World</h2><p>The first volume of Arnold Rampersad's <em>The Life of Langston Hughes</em> was published in 1986 to enormous acclaim.

Now Rampersad gives us the second and final volume of his epic biography of black America's most original and beloved poet.<br> Rampersad traces Hughes's life from the humiliations of 1940-41, with his career in jeopardy, to his death in 1967, by which time he was revered not only as the dean of Afro-American writers but also as a world-renowned artist whose poems, plays, and stories had profoundly influenced writers in Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. This volume shows Hughes re-examining his vision of art and radicalism during World War II, when he contributed steadily to the national war effort even as he relentlessly attacked segregation in his country. It recounts his surveillance by the FBI and his hounding by right-wing forces, including Senator Joe McCarthy, who eventually forced him to testify about his radical years.<br> Through all this period, Rampersad reveals, Hughes never lost sight of his greatest goal: to be an artist in words, committed to black life. His desire resulted in books of verse and fiction that reflected his love of jazz and the blues; in operas in which he collaborated with Kurt Weill, William Grant Still, and Jan Meyerowitz; in musical plays that first brought black gospel to the American stage; in a dozen books for children; and in programs for radio and television featuring stars such as Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier. His passion for life and literature brought him into fellowship--and sometimes sharp conflict--with a wide range of writers, including Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, and Amiri Baraka.<br> Written with Rampersad's characteristic grace and meticulous attention to detail, this book combines with the first volume to offer a matchless panorama of life and culture in America and abroad during the first 70 years of this century.</p><p>Rampersad, one of our foremost African-American scholars, is an apt biographer for Hughes (1902-67), our greatest black poet. <i>I, Too, Sing America</i> (volume 1) covers the years during which Hughes produced his best work and was most politically active; <i> Dream a World</i> (volume 2) chronicles his artistic decline due to overwork in= response to perpetual financial difficulties. Both volumes are psychologically astute, critically penetrating and masterful in their intermingling of Hughes' story with a chronicle of the enormous changes that took place in black America during his lifetime.Arnold Rampersad, Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature, Princeton University.</p><h2>Paradise</h2><p>When her family empire is threatened by a hostile takeover attempt, Meredith Bancroft turns to her former lover, Matthew Farrell, now a self-made corporate tycoon, stirring up old memories</p><p>Judith McNaught is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author who first soared to stardom with her stunning bestseller <i>Whitney, My Love</i>, and went on to win the hearts of millions of readers with <i>Once and Always</i>, <i>Something Wonderful</i>, <i>A Kingdom of Dreams</i>,<i> Almost Heaven</i>,<i> Paradise</i>, <i>Perfect</i>, <i>Until You</i>, <i>Remember When</i>, <i>Someone to Watch Over Me</i>, the #1 bestseller <i>Night Whispers</i>, and other novels. There are more than thirty million copies of her books in print. She lives in Frisco, Texas.<b>"Chapter 1"</b><br><br><i>December 1973</i><br><br>With her scrapbook opened beside her on her canopied bed, Meredith Bancroft carefully cut out the picture from the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> The caption read, <i>Children of Chicago socialites, dressed as elves, participate in charity Christmas pageant at Oakland Memorial Hospital,</i> then it listed their names. Beneath the caption picture of the "elves" -- five boys and five girls, including Meredith -- who were handing out presents to the children's ward. Standing off to the left, supervising the proceedings, was a handsome young man of eighteen, who the caption referred to as "Parker Reynolds III, son of Mr. and Mrs. Parker Reynolds of Kenilworth."<br><br>Impartially, Meredith compared herself to the other girls in the elf costumes, wondering, how they could manage to look leggy and curvy while she looked..."Dumpy!" she pronounced with a pained grimace."I look like a troll, not an elf!"<br><br>It did not seem at all fair that the other girls who were fourteen, just a few small weeks older than she was, should look so wonderful while she looked like a flat-chested troll with braces. Her gaze shifted to her picture and she regretted again the streak of vanity that had caused her to take off her glasses for the photograph; without them she had a tendency to squint -- just like she was doing in that awful picture."Contact lenses would definitely help," she concluded. Her gaze switched to Parker's picture, and a dreamy smile drifted across her face as she clasped the newspaper clipping to what would have been her breasts if she <i>had</i> breasts, which she didn't. Not yet. At this rate, not ever.<br><br>The door to her bedroom opened and Meredith hastily yanked the picture from her chest as the stout, sixty-year-old housekeeper came in to take her dinner tray away."You didn't eat your dessert," Mrs. Ellis chided.<br><br>"I'm fat, Mrs. Ellis," Meredith said. To prove it, she scrambled off the antique bed and marched over to the mirror above her dressing table."Look at me," she said, pointing an accusing finger at her reflection."I have no waistline!"<br><br>"You have some baby fat there, that's all."<br><br>"I don't have hips either. I look like a walking two-by-four. No wonder I have no friends -- "<br><br>Mrs. Ellis, who'd worked for the Bancrofts for less than a year, looked amazed. "You have no friends? Why not?"<br><br>Desperately in need of someone to confide in, Meredith said, "I've only pretended that everything is fine at school. The truth is, it's terrible. I'm a complete misfit. I've always been a misfit."<br><br>"Well, I never! There must be something wrong with the children in your school...."<br><br>"It isn't them, it's <i>me,</i> but I'm going to change," Meredith announced. "I've gone on a diet, and I want to do something with my hair. It's awful."<br><br>"It's <i>not</i> awful!" Mrs. Ellis argued, looking at Meredith's shoulder-length pale blond hair and then her turquoise eyes. "You have striking eyes and very nice hair. Nice and thick and -- "<br><br>"Colorless."<br><br>"Blond."<br><br>Meredith stared stubbornly at the mirror, her mind magnifying the flaws that existed. "I'm almost five feet seven inches tall. It's a lucky thing I finally stopped growing before I became a giant! But I'm not hopeless, I realized that on Saturday."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis's brows drew together in confusion. "What happened on Saturday to change your mind about yourself?"<br><br>"Nothing earth-shattering," Meredith said. <i>Something earth-shattering,</i> she thought. <i>Parker smiled at me at the Christmas pageant. He brought me a Coke without being asked. He told me to be sure and save a dance for him Saturday at the Eppingham party.</i> Seventy-five years before, Parker's family had founded the large Chicago bank where Bancroft &amp; Company's funds were deposited, and the friendship between the Bancrofts and Reynoldses had endured for generations. "Everything is going to change now, not just the way I look," Meredith continued happily as she turned away from the mirror. "I'm going to have a friend too! There's a new girl at school, and she doesn't know that no one else likes me. She's smart, like I am, and she called me tonight to ask me a homework question. She <i>called</i> me, and we talked about all sorts of things."<br><br>"I did notice you never brought friends home from school," Mrs. Ellis said, wringing her hands in nervous dismay, "but I thought it was because you lived so far away."<br><br>"No, it isn't that," Meredith said, flopping down onto the bed and staring self-consciously at her serviceable slippers that looked just like small replicas of the ones her father wore. Despite their wealth, Meredith's father had the liveliest respect for money; all of her clothing was of excellent quality and was purchased only when necessary, always with a stem eye toward durability. "I dont fit in, you see."<br><br>"When I was a girl," Mrs. Ellis said with a sudden look of comprehension, "we were always a little leery of children who got good grades."<br><br>"It's not just that," Meredith said wryly. "It's something besides the way I look and the grades I get that makes me a misfit. It's -- all this," she said, and made a sweeping gesture that encompassed the large, rather austere room with its antique furniture, a room whose character resembled all the other forty-five rooms in the Bancroft estate. "Everyone thinks I'm completely weird because Father insists that Fenwick drive me to school."<br><br>"What's wrong with that, may I ask?"<br><br>"The other children walk or ride the school bus."<br><br>"So?"<br><br>"So they do <i>not</i> arrive in a chauffeur-driven Rolls!" Almost wistfully, Meredith added, "Their fathers are plumbers and accountants. One of them works for us at the store."<br><br>Unable to argue with the logic of that, and unwilling to admit it was true, Mrs. Ellis said, "But this new girl in school -- she doesn't find it odd that Fenwick drives you?"<br><br>"No," Meredith said with a guilty chuckle that made her eyes glow with sudden liveliness behind her glasses, "because she thinks Fenwick <i>is</i> my father! I told her my father works for some rich people who own a big store."<br><br>"You didn't!"<br><br>"Yes, I did, and I -- I'm not sorry. I should have spread that around school years ago, only I didn't want to lie."<br><br>"But now you don't mind lying?" Mrs. Ellis said with a censorious look.<br><br>"It <i>isn't</i> a lie, not entirely," Meredith said in an imploring voice. "Father explained it to me a long time ago. You see, Bancroft &amp; Company is a corporation, and a corporation is actually owned by the stockholders. So you see, as president of Bancroft &amp; Company, Father is -- technically -- employed by the stockholders. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Probably not," she said flatly. "Who owns the stock?"<br><br> Meredith sent her a guilty look. "We do, mostly."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis found the whole notion of the operation of Bancroft &amp; Company, a famous downtown Chicago department store, absolutely baffling, but Meredith frequently displayed an uncanny understanding of the business. Although, Mrs. Ellis thought with helpless ire at Meredith's father, it wasn't so uncanny -- not when the man had no interest in his daughter <i>except</i> when he was lecturing her about that store. In fact, Mrs. Ellis thought Philip Bancroft was probably to blame for his daughter's inability to fit in with the other girls her age. He treated his daughter like an adult, and he insisted that she speak and act like one at all times. On the rare occasions when he entertained friends, Meredith even acted as his hostess. As a result, Meredith was very much at ease with adults and obviously at a complete loss with her peers.<br><br>"You're right about one thing though," Meredith said. "I can't go on tricking Lisa Pontini about Fenwick being my father. I just thought that if she had a chance to know me first, it might not matter when I tell her Fenwick is actually our chauffeur. The only reason she hasn't found out already is that she doesn't know anyone else in our class, and she always has to go straight home after school. She has seven brothers and sisters, and she has to help out at home."<br><br>Mrs. Ellis reached out and awkwardly patted Meredith's arm, trying to think of something encouraging to say. "Things always look brighter in the morning," she announced, resorting, as she often did, to one of the cozy clich�s she herself found so comforting. She picked up the dinner tray, then paused in the doorway, struck with another inspiring platitude. "And remember this," she instructed Meredith in the rising tones of one who is about to impart a very satisfying thought, "every <i>dog</i> has its <i>day!"</i><br><br>Meredith didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Thank you, Mrs. Ellis," she said, "that is <i>very</i> encouraging." In mortified silence she watched the door close behind the housekeeper, then she slowly picked up the scrapbook. When the <i>Tribune</i> clipping had been safely taped to the page, she stared at it for a long moment, then reached out and lightly touched Parker's smiling mouth. The thought of actually dancing with him made her shiver with, a mixture of terror and anticipation. This was Thursday, and the Eppingham dance was the day after tomorrow. It see like years to wait.<br><br>Sighing, she flipped backward through the pages of the big scrapbook. At the front were some very old clippings, yellowed now with age, the pictures faded. The scrapbook had originally belonged to her mother, Caroline, and it contained the only tangible proof in the house that Caroline Edwards Bancroft had ever existed. Everything else connected with her had been removed at Philip Bancroft's instructions.<br><br>Caroline Edwards had been an actress -- not an especially good one, according to her reviews -- but an unquestionably glamorous one. Meredith studied the faded pictures, but she didn't read what the columnists had written because she knew every word by heart. She knew that Cary Grant had escorted her mother to the Academy Awards in 1955, and that David Niven had said she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen, and that David Selznick had wanted her in one of his pictures. She knew that her mother had roles in three Broadway musicals and that the critics had panned her acting but praised her shapely legs. The gossip columnists had hinted at serious romances between Caroline and nearly all her leading men. There were clippings of her, draped in furs, attending a party in Rome; wrapped in a strapless black evening gown, playing roulette in Monte Carlo. In one photograph she was clad in a skimpy bikini on the beach in Monaco, in another, siding in Gstaad with a Swiss Olympic Gold Medalist. It was obvious to Meredith that wherever she went, Caroline had been surrounded by handsome men.<br><br>The last clipping her mother had saved was dated six months after the one in Gstaad. She was wearing a magnificent white wedding gown -- laughing and running down the cathedral steps on Philip Bancrofts arm beneath a shower of rice. The society columnists had outdone themselves with extravagant descriptions of the wedding. The reception at the Palmer House Hotel had been dosed to the press, but the columnists faithfully reported all the famous guests who were present, from the Vanderbilts and Whitneys, to a Supreme Court justice and four U.S. senators.<br><br>The marriage lasted two years -- long enough for Caroline to get pregnant, have her baby, have a sleazy affair with a horse trainer, and then go running off to Europe with a phony Italian prince who'd been a guest in this very house Beyond that, Meredith knew little, except that her mother had never bothered to send her so much as a note or a birthday card. Meredith's father, who placed great emphasis on dignity and old-fashioned values, said her mother was a self-centered slut without the slightest conception of marital fidelity or maternal responsibility. When Meredith was a year old, he had filed for divorce and for custody of Meredith, fully prepared to exert all the Bancroft family's considerable political and social influence to assure that he won his suit. In the end he hadn't needed to resort to that. According to what he'd told Meredith, her mother hadn't bothered to wait around for the court hearing, let alone try to oppose him.<br><br>Once he was granted custody of Meredith, her father had set out to ensure that she would never follow her mother's example. Instead, he was determined that Meredith would take her place in a long line of dignified Bancroft women who'd led exemplary lives dedicated to charitable good works that befitted their station, and to which not a single breath of scandal had ever been attached.<br><br>When it came time for her to start school, Philip had discovered to his annoyance that standards of conduct were relaxing, even among his own social class. Many of his acquaintances were taking a more liberal view of child behavior and sending their children to "progressive" schools like Bently and Ridgeview. When he inspected these schools, he heard phrases like "unstructured classes" and "self-expression." Progressive education sounded undisciplined to him; it foretold lower standards of education and deportment. After rejecting both those schools, he took Meredith with him to see St. Stephen's -- a private Catholic school ran by the Benedictine nuns, the same school his aunt and his mother had attended.<br><br>Her father had approved of all he saw the day they visited St. Stephen's: Thirty-four first-grade girls in demure gray-and-blue-plaid jumpers, and ten boys in white shirts and blue ties, had come instantly and respectfully to their feet when the nun had shown him the classroom. Forty-four young voices had chorused, <i>"Good morning, Sister."</i> Furthermore, St. Stephen's still taught academics in the good old-fashioned way -- unlike Bently, where he'd seen some children finger-painting while the other students, who <i>chose</i> to learn, worked on math. As an added benefit, Meredith would receive strict moral training here as well.<br><br>Her father was not oblivious to the fact that the neighborhood surrounding St. Stephen's had deteriorated, but he was obsessed with the idea that Meredith be raised in the same manner as the other upstanding, upright Bancroft women who had attended St. Stephen's for three generations. He solved the matter of the neighborhood by having the family chauffeur drive Meredith to and from school.<br><br>The one thing he didn't realize was that the girls and boys who attended St. Stephen's were not the virtuous little beings they'd seemed to be that day. They were ordinary kids from lower-middle-class families and even some poor families; they played together and walked to school together, and they shared a common suspicion of anyone from an entirely different and far more prosperous background.<br><br>Meredith hadn't known about that when she arrived at St. Stephen's to start first grade. Clad in her neat gray-and-blue-plaid uniform jumper and carrying her new lunch pail, she'd quaked with the nervous excitement of any six-year-old confronting a class filled with strangers, but she'd felt little actual fear. After spending her whole life in relative loneliness, with only her father and the servants as companions, she was happily anticipating the prospect of finally having friends her own age.<br><br>The first day at school went well enough, but it took a sudden turn for the worse when classes were dismissed and the students poured out the school doors into the playground and parking lot. Fenwick had been waiting in the playground, standing beside the Rolls in his black chauffeur's uniform. The older children had stopped and stared and then identified her as being rich, ergo "different."<br><br>That alone was enough to make them...</p><h2>Unfinished Agenda: Urban Politics in the Era of Black Power</h2><p><i>Unfinished Agenda</i> offers an inside look at the Black Power Movement that emerged during the Civil Rights Movement of the sixties.

Accompanied by twenty-two compelling photographs highlighting key life events, <i>Unfinished Agenda</i> chronicles the turbulent times during the Civil Rights Movement and Williams's participation every step of the way including his experiences on the front lines of racial riots in Newark and the historic riot in Montgomery, Alabama with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.<br><br> Williams speaks of his many opportunities and experiences--beginning with his education at Amherst College and Yale Law School, his travel to Uganda and Kenya, and working in Harlem. His passion for fighting racism ultimately led him to many years of service in politics in Newark, New Jersey as a community organizer and leader. Williams advocates for renewed community organizing and voting for a progressive party to carry out the "Unfinished Agenda" the Black Power Movement outlined in America during the 60s and early 70s for empowerment of the people.</p><p>Listed among Ebony&#39;s &#34;100 Most Influential Blacks in America,&#34; JUNIUS W.

Sir Kenneth Clark calls it &#34;unquestionably the most beautiful illustrated Dante in existence.&#34;Dante's Divine Comedy has inspired artists from Giotto down to the present. Perhaps among the most beautiful illustrations are those of the 15th-century Sienese painter Giovanni di Paolo, who illuminated a Paradiso manuscript for the library of the King of Naples, now in the British Library as Yates-Thompson MS 36. Pope-Hennessy, the noted British art historian, presents reproductions of di Paolo's 61 illuminations in a large format and in full color.

Her reign, the longest in Russian Imperial history, lasted from 1762 until her death in 1796; during those years she built on the work begun by her most famous predecessor, Peter the Great, to establish Russia as a major European power and to transform its new capital, St Petersburg, into a city to rival Paris and London in the beauty of its architecture, the glittering splendor of its Court and the magnificence of its art collections. Yet the great Catherine was not even Russian by birth and had no legitimate claim to the Russian throne; she seized it and held on to it, through wars, rebellions and plagues, by the force of her personality, by her charm and determination, and by an unshakable belief in her own destiny.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is the story of Catherine the woman, whom power alone could never satisfy, for she also wanted love, affection, friendship and humor. She found these in letter-writing, in grandchildren, in gardens, architecture and greyhounds--as well as in a succession of lovers which gave rise to salacious rumors throughout Europe. The real Catherine, however, was more interesting than any rumor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Using many of Catherine's own words from her voluminous correspondence and other documents, as well as contemporary accounts by courtiers, ambassadors and foreign visitors, Virginia Rounding penetrates the character of this most powerful, fascinating and surprisingly sympathetic of eighteenth-century women.</p><p>Virginia Rounding is a translator and writer who lives in London.

She was the first child of her 39-year-old father Prince Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst and her 17-year-old mother Princess Johanna Elizabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Sophie and Auguste were the names of one of the baby&#x2019;s great-grandmothers on her father&#x2019;s side, while Frederica &#x2013; which may also have been chosen as a mark of respect to Prince Christian August&#x2019;s patron, King Frederick William of Prussia &#x2013; was the name of both one of her mother&#x2019;s elder sisters and her mother&#x2019;s paternal grandmother.</p><p>Anhalt-Zerbst and Holstein-Gottorp were two of the 300 or so tiny sovereign states, or principalities, of which the area roughly covered by present-day Germany consisted in the eighteenth century. The prerevolutionary Russian historian V.O. Klyuchevsky describes these endlessly dividing and subdividing states, with their &#x2018;princes of Brunswick-Luneberg and Brunswick-Wolfenb�ttel; of Saxe-Romburg, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe-Gotha, and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz; of Schleswig-Holstein, Holstein-Gottorp, and Gottorp-Eutin; of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Zerbst, and Zerbst-Dornburg&#x2019;, as &#x2018;an archaic feudal anthill&#x2019;. Everyone in these noble families seems to have been related to everyone else, even if only through marriage and at several removes. (Many of them also seem to have had the same Christian names, in different combinations, which can be very confusing.) There were also many cross-border allegiances, the members of one princely house serving in the army or civil service of a more powerful one and being rewarded with money, position or influence. Prince Christian August&#x2019;s father, who had died in 1704, was Prince Johann Ludwig of Anhalt-Zerbst, himself the son of Prince Johann of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Sophie Auguste of Holstein-Gottorp. Sophie&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s side of the family was rather more elevated, with closer connections to the occupants of thrones; one of Princess Johanna&#x2019;s great-grandfathers had been King Frederick III of Denmark. Her father was Christian August, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who also held the office of Bishop of L�beck until his death in 1726 (&#x2018;Bishop of L�beck&#x2019; was a hereditary title, the bishopric being in the possession of the House of Holstein-Gottorp until the secularisation of 1803). His parents were Christian Albrecht, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Frederica Amalie Oldenburg, Princess of Denmark. Johanna&#x2019;s mother was Albertine Markgr�fin of Baden-Durlach, the daughter of Friedrich VII Magnus Markgraf of Baden-Durlach and Princess Auguste Marie of Holstein-Gottorp; she had married Christian August in 1704. Albertine was the only one of Sophie&#x2019;s grandparents still to be alive at the time of her birth.</p><p>For any girl born into this &#x2018;feudal anthill&#x2019;, competition to make a good marriage and thus secure for her family a better place in the pecking order would be fierce. Sophie always felt that her parents would have preferred a boy as their firstborn, but that nevertheless her father at least was pleased by her arrival in the world. Throughout her life she retained a great respect for Prince Christian August, thinking of him as a model of integrity, honesty and erudition. One of Christian August&#x2019;s cousins was Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau (known as the &#x2018;Alte Dessauer&#x2019;), who had the reputation of being an exceedingly brave soldier and who had assisted the military martinet King Frederick William in devising the 54 movements of Prussian drill, including the ceremonial march-past with unbent leg which came to be known as the goosestep. Prince Leopold was King Frederick William&#x2019;s most trusted general; Christian August himself, who had also served with distinction in the Prussian army, was not far behind in the King&#x2019;s esteem. At the time of Sophie&#x2019;s birth he was the Governor of Stettin, having been sent by King Frederick William to command the garrison there just after his marriage in 1727. He was a serious and austere man and a committed Lutheran, who preferred the company of books to social gatherings.</p><p>His young wife Johanna, with her aquiline nose, arched eyebrows and curly fair hair, was of a different character altogether. She had been brought up at the Court of Brunswick by her godmother and aunt by marriage, Elizabeth Sophie Marie, the Duchess of Brunswick-L�neberg, to whom the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp had been happy to relinquish one of his several daughters. Johanna had grown up on the same footing as the Duchess of Brunswick-L�neberg&#x2019;s own daughter, and it was the Duchess who arranged her marriage at the age of 15 and provided her dowry. It would be an anachronism to draw any psychological conclusion from the fact that the young Johanna married in 1727 a man old enough to be her father and who had the same Christian names as her own father, who had died in the previous year; nevertheless, it is true to say that there was something of a father-daughter relationship between Sophie&#x2019;s rather ill-matched parents.</p><p>Johanna found her existence with her sober middle-aged husband in the misty grey town of Stettin at the mouth of the river Oder a far cry from the livelier atmosphere she had grown used to at the Court of Brunswick. In Stettin the Governor and his family lived in the ducal castle (now known as the Castle of the Pomeranian Princes), a sixteenth-century granite building in the main square. The city offered little scope to a young woman who hankered after an exciting social life. Neither did the advent of her first child appear to bring Johanna much joy. Her attitude towards Sophie was always ambivalent. The birth had been difficult, and Johanna appears to have felt the reward was insufficient for what she had had to endure; according to her daughter, she almost died in the process and it took her 19 weeks to recover.</p><p>The infant Sophie, who had very fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes, was handed over to a wet-nurse and placed in the overall charge of &#x2018;the widow of a certain Herr von Hohendorf&#x2019;, who also acted as a companion to Johanna. Frau von Hohendorf did not retain her position for long, failing in her relations with both the child and her mother. She was given to shouting, with the result that the small girl got into the habit of ignoring any order unless it was said repeatedly and in a very loud voice. Sophie was rescued from incipient uncontrollability, however, by the advent of the Cardel sisters, part of a family of Huguenot refugees. The elder sister, Magdeleine, who had charge of her until she was about four years old, did not succeed in capturing the child&#x2019;s affection, but her successor, her younger sister Elizabeth, usually known as Babet, was able to win her over and secured a lasting place in her memory and in the pantheon of people she believed to have influenced her for good. Sophie saw little of her father, though she seems to have been sure of his rather distant affection (&#x2018;[he] considered me to be an angel&#x2019;), and even less of her mother, who, she remembers, &#x2018;did not bother much about me&#x2019;. She had been supplanted in her mother&#x2019;s affections (if indeed she had ever been in them at all) by the much-desired son, William Christian Frederick, who had arrived 18 months after her own birth. She herself was, as she put it, &#x2018;merely tolerated&#x2019; &#x2013; and at times not even that. Babet Cardel made up for this lack of parental care, taking the little girl &#x2013; who had become rather spoilt as well as neglected &#x2013; in hand. She taught her to read, while visiting tutors provided elementary lessons in writing and dancing.</p><p>When Sophie was three years old, she had been taken by her parents to visit her grandmother Albertine in Hamburg. An even more exciting event took place when she was four: King Frederick William of Prussia came to visit the small Court at Stettin, and little Sophie was instructed to greet him formally by kissing the hem of his coat. She was, however, too short to reach it, a fact about which she claims to have complained audibly, blaming the King for not wearing a longer coat; the incident remained in Frederick William&#x2019;s memory so that subsequently he always asked after her. Sophie suffered the usual round of childhood accidents, including having a toy cupboard fall on her and almost sticking a pair of scissors in her eye. In early childhood she was subject to outbreaks of a skin disease which would now be called impetigo. When the rash appeared on her hands she wore gloves until the scabs fell off, and when her scalp became affected she had to have her hair shaved off and wear a bonnet.</p><p>Much of the instruction the young Sophie received consisted of rote learning, which she later came to despise as both bad for the memory and a waste of time; what was the point of learning things by heart, she wondered, when you could just as easily go and look them up in a book? She was taught both French and German, and was also instructed in religion, history and geography by a Lutheran pastor called Wagner, with whom she had several tussles over such questions as whether those who had never had a chance to hear the Gospel &#x2013; &#x2018;Titus, Marcus Aurelius, and all the great men of antiquity&#x2019; &#x2013; could really be damned for eternity, and the nature of the chaos which preceded creation. The picture the adult woman was keen to produce in her memoirs was of an independent-minded, intellectually courageous child who would not be cowed into accepting received opinion. She also recalls asking the pastor to explain what circumcision was, a question which even the valiant Babet Cardel refused to answer.</p><p>Though her mother occasionally hit her, out of impatience and exasperation, corporal punishment was not a routine part of Sophie&#x2019;s childhood. Pastor Wagner, she claims, wanted her to be flogged for her impertinence in asking too many questions, but Babet Cardel was not authorised to carry out such punishments. Deprived of the rod, the pastor took to the infliction of mental torture instead, frightening the child with stories of hell and damnation until Babet noticed her charge crying by the window and persuaded him to desist. The sensible Babet used the approach of the carrot rather than the stick, rewarding Sophie for good work and behaviour by reading aloud to her.</p><p>The adult woman remembered herself as a boisterous child, who would pretend to go to sleep at bedtime but sit up as soon as she was left alone and turn her pillow into an imaginary horse, bouncing up and down on it until she was tired. (It has sometimes been assumed that what she was in fact doing was masturbating; admittedly children sometimes do, but they also pretend pillows are horses...) Her other night-time trick, indulged in when the family was staying at her father&#x2019;s country estate in Anhalt, consisted of racing up four flights of stone stairs whenever Babet left the room to go to the privy, which was along a short passage, then running back down to throw herself under the covers before the rather stout and slow-moving woman returned.</p><p>As Sophie grew older, Johanna seemed to find the company of her little girl more acceptable. In 1736 she took the child to the Court of Brunswick for the first time to meet the woman to whom she owed her own upbringing and marriage, the Duchess Elizabeth Sophie Marie of Brunswick-L�neberg. Still aged only seven, Sophie greatly enjoyed herself, prattling away, being spoiled and petted and, as she put it herself, &#x2018;insufferably forward&#x2019;. Johanna was in the habit of staying at this Court for several months of every year (escaping from the boredom of Stettin), and from now on Sophie always went with her. This was where she first experienced the routines and rituals of formal court life, a training which would prove invaluable to her. Around the time of this first visit, she became aware of the kind of future which might await her, and of the possibility of aiming high. In her memoirs she attributes this realisation to comments made by Dr Laurentius Bolhagen, a close friend and adviser of her father. Bolhagen was reading a gazette containing an account of the marriage of Princess Auguste of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, one of Sophie&#x2019;s second cousins, to the Prince of Wales (in April 1736), and he commented to Babet Cardel: &#x2018;Really, this Princess has been much less carefully brought up than ours; she is not beautiful either, but there she is, destined to become Queen of England! Who knows what future faces ours?&#x2019;</p><p>In the same year, Sophie suffered her first serious illness; from the symptoms she describes &#x2013; initially a violent cough and sharp chest pains &#x2013; it was clearly a form of pneumonia. In the same year Johanna also suffered the death of a baby daughter, Auguste. Sophie spent three weeks in bed with a fever, the cough and chest pains continuing, only able to lie on her left side. Such medical treatment as was provided for her was experimental; as she herself recalled: &#x2018;I was given many mixtures to take, but God alone knows what they were!&#x2019; When she was finally well enough to get out of bed, it was observed that she had developed a pronounced curvature of the spine. This appears rather to have frightened her parents, who were already having to cope with one disabled child, the elder of Sophie&#x2019;s two brothers (her second brother, Frederick August, having been born in 1734) being able to walk only with the aid of crutches. It seems more than likely that both children were affected by rickets, a condition where skeletal deformities occur as a result of vitamin D deficiency and a lack of direct sunlight. They were keen to keep the news of Sophie&#x2019;s apparent deformity within the family; if it were to become public, it would seriously damage her marriage prospects. Her parents&#x2019; horrified reaction cannot have done much for Sophie&#x2019;s already fragile self-confidence. Neither can the bizarre treatment they eventually procured for her. The only local person they could find with a reputation for skill in straightening out &#x2018;dislocations&#x2019; was the town&#x2019;s executioner. After examining Sophie in the greatest secrecy, he ordered that her back and shoulders should be rubbed every day with the saliva of a servant girl, who was under strict orders not to eat anything beforehand. It is possible that the massage may have done Sophie some good, but in addition she was made to wear, night and day, an uncomfortable corset. Curiously, the executioner also gave her a black ribbon to wear round her right arm and shoulder. After about 18 months, Sophie&#x2019;s spine began to grow straight again, and by the time she was II she was allowed to stop wearing the corset (though it would in any event have been quite normal for a girl of her age and time to wear at least a reinforced bodice to push back the shoulders and thus keep the back flat).</p><p>Clearly Sophie&#x2019;s parents did not believe in mollycoddling their little girl. Neither did they act with much sensitivity. Around the same time that she became ill they decided she was too old for dolls and other toys, so they were all confiscated. The grown woman claims not to have suffered much from this, as she was imaginative enough to turn anything that came to hand into a toy. Arguably, this is where she first learnt how to make the best of a not particularly good situation, how to bide her time, be watchful, retreat into her inner self and prepare for the time when she would be able to act, even though this was hardly a conscious strategy at the ag...</p></p><h2>3 Cookbooks in 1: All New Diabetic Cooking</h2><p>3 Cookbooks in 1: All New Diabetic Cooking is proof that diabetic cooking doesn't have to mean sacrificing flavor.

Upon seeing the monumental work of Jos� Clemente Orozco, however, he abruptly lost his nerve: "It seemed an act of self-delusion to try to be a painter."<p> After 44 years, Hamill has found a way to integrate his early affair with art, his lifelong love of Mexico, and his narrative gifts in this riveting and lushly illustrated book on Diego Rivera, Mexico's best-known, widely loved muralist. Hamill's text, he says, was completed before the publication of Patrick Marnham's <i>Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera</i>. This one is less scholarly but respectably researched, and Hamill's fervent opinions on which of Rivera's works are worthy and which are the sad effluvia of a Communist Party hack are remarkably persuasive. Hamill's esthetic judgment has led him to avoid reproducing any second-rate clunkers. He has chosen the great murals, paintings, and drawings that suit the godlike stature of this outsize artist who lied, cheated, womanized, and evaded responsibility his entire life, but who worked like a demon in the service of his art. </p><p> Rivera's shabby genteel childhood; his flight to France during the 10-year Mexican Revolution, during which nearly a tenth of his countrymen died; his callous abandonment of his first wife; his ugly political gambits and high-flown society contacts; his ultimately sad relationships with both men and women--Hamill weaves it all into a fantastic read. The book is not as balanced as <i>Dreaming with His Eyes Open</i>, but is nonetheless a passionate first look at an artist whose complicated life will probably still be examined decades from now. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>"In this tight and balanced look at Mexican painter Diego Rivera, Pete Hamill focuses on Rivera's work.

Who was he, and what caused him to disappear? Was he simply a physicist, or also a spy and communist radical? A prot�g� of Enrico Fermi, Pontecorvo was one of the most promising nuclear physicists in the world. He spent years hunting for the Higgs boson of his day&#x2014;the neutrino&#x2014;a nearly massless particle thought to be essential to the process of particle decay. His work on the Manhattan Project helped to usher in the nuclear age, and confirmed his reputation as a brilliant physicist. Why, then, would he disappear as he stood on the cusp of true greatness, perhaps even the Nobel Prize?<br><br>In <i>Half-Life</i>, physicist and historian Frank Close offers a heretofore untold history of Pontecorvo's life, based on unprecedented access to Pontecorvo's friends and family and the Russian scientists with whom he would later work. Close takes a microscope to Pontecorvo's life, combining a thorough biography of one of the most important scientsts of the twentieth century with the drama of Cold War espionage.

John M. Hart destroys some old myths and brings new information to light as he explores anarchism's effect on the development of the Mexican urban working-class and agrarian movements.</p> <p>Hart shows how the ideas of European anarchist thinkers took root in Mexico, how they influenced revolutionary tendencies there, and why anarchism was ultimately unsuccessful in producing real social change in Mexico. He explains the role of the working classes during the Mexican Revolution, the conflict between urban revolutionary groups and peasants, and the ensuing confrontation between the new revolutionary elite and the urban working class.</p> <p>The anarchist tradition traced in this study is extremely complex. It involves various social classes, including intellectuals, artisans, and ordinary workers; changing social conditions; and political and revolutionary events which reshaped ideologies. During the nineteenth century the anarchists could be distinguished from their various working- class socialist and trade unionist counterparts by their singular opposition to government. In the twentieth century the lines became even clearer because of hardening anarchosyndicalist, anarchistcommunist, trade unionist, and Marxist doctrines. In charting the rise and fall of anarchism, Hart gives full credit to the roles of other forms of socialism and Marxism in Mexican working-class history.</p> <p>Mexican anarchists whose contributions are examined here include nineteenth-century leaders Plotino Rhodakanaty, Santiago Villanueva, Francisco Zalacosta, and Jos� Mar�a Gonzales; the twentieth-century revolutionary precursor Ricardo Flores Mag�n; the Casa del Obrero founders Amadeo Ferr�s, Juan Francisco Moncaleano, and Rafael Quintero; and the majority of the Centro Sindicalista Ubertario, leaders of the General Confederation of Workers.</p> <p>This work is based largely on primary sources, and the bibliography contains a definitive listing of anarchist and radical working-class newspapers for the period.</p></p><p>John M.

Willie McGee, the quiet one, had left both his parents behind in Chicago to be raised by his older brother in Akron. Dru Joyce was outspoken, and his dad was ever present; he would end up coaching all five of the boys in high school. Sian Cotton, who also played football, was the happy-go-lucky enforcer, while Romeo Travis was unhappy, bitter, even surly, until he finally opened himself up to the bond his teammates offered him. </p> <p> In the summer after seventh grade, the Shooting Stars tasted glory when they qualified for a national championship tournament in Memphis. But they lost their focus and had to go home early. They promised one another they would stay together and do whatever it took to win a national title. </p><p> They had no idea how hard it would be to fulfill that promise. In the years that followed, they would endure jealousy, hostility, exploitation, resentment from the black community (because they went to a &#x201c;white&#x201d; high school), and the consequences of their own overconfidence. Not least, they would all have to wrestle with LeBron&#x2019;s outsize success, which brought too much attention and even a whiff of scandal their way. But together these five boys became men, and together they claimed the prize they had fought for all those years&#x2014;a national championship. </p> <p> Shooting Stars is a stirring depiction of the challenges that face America&#x2019;s youth today and a gorgeous evocation of the transcendent impact of teamwork. </p></p><p><p> <b>LeBron James</b>plays for the NBA&#x2019;s Cleveland Cavaliers.

If you went high up on North Hill in the 1980s, you could tell that life was not like it once was: the obsolete smokestacks in the distance, the downtown that felt so tired and weary. I won&#x2019;t deny it&#x2014;there was something painful about all of that. It got to me, this place in northeastern Ohio that had once been so mighty (at one point it was the fastest-growing city in the country) but was mighty no more. This place that was struggling to be something again.</p><p>It was still my hometown. The more I rode my bike around, and you could ride just about everywhere because it was midwestern small and compact, the more familiar I became with it. I rode along Copley Road, the main thoroughfare of West Akron, past the dark of redbrick apartment buildings with red-trimmed windows. A little bit farther up, I went past the Laundry King and Queen Beauty Supply. Riding along East Avenue, which took you from the western part of the city into the south, I went past modest two-story homes with porches and the brown concrete of the Ed Davis Community Center.</p><p>I descended into the valley of South Akron along Thornton Street, past the blond brick of Roush&#x2019;s Market and the Stewart &amp; Calhoun Funeral Home. South Akron was a tough neighborhood, but still I rode, past Akron Automatic Screw Products and the aluminum siding of the Thornton Terrace apartments. Along Johnston Street I went into the east side, past simple homes of red and green and blue that looked like a rainbow. I turned south on Arlington, past the Arlington Church of God and Bethel Baptist and Allied Auto. I came to the Goodyear clock tower, towering high like the Washington Monument and the great symbol of what Akron had once been, the &#x201c;Rubber Capital of the World,&#x201d; producing tires by the millions until all the great factories closed.</p><p>I biked up the north side into a section of the city known as the Bottom and went past the Elizabeth Park projects&#x2014;my own home for a time&#x2014;two-story apartment buildings in unsmiling rows, some of which had been condemned, some of which had been boarded up, some that had screen doors with the hinges torn off or the wire mesh stripped away. I headed back west and biked along Portage Path, a wealthy section of town with sprawling houses of brick and stone and shiny black shutters all perfectly aligned.</p><p>I knew I would never live there unless some miracle happened, something fell from the sky, a shooting star that landed on top of me and my mom and made our lives better and carried us up from the projects. But that wasn&#x2019;t the Akron I thought of anyway. Much of it was taken up by the neighborhoods that I went past on my bike, humble homes with tiny tufts of lawn that people tended and took care of. Because even in my darkest days growing up, and there were some dark ones, ones that left me up half the night scared and lonely and worried, that&#x2019;s what Akron always meant to me&#x2014;people taking care of things, people taking care of each other, people who found you and protected you and treated you like their own son even when you weren&#x2019;t. With a population of about 225,000 when I was growing up, it was still small enough to feel intimate, a place you could put your arms around, a place that would put its arms around you.</p><p>There was something wholesome about it, the best of the Midwest, Cleveland without the &#x2019;hoods where you could go in and never come back out. One of my favorite spots in town was Swensons, which, straight out of <i>Happy Days</i>, still served up a burger and fries and Cherry Coke on a tray that was attached to the window of your car by a goofy-looking teenager still dealing with acne. I loved those burgers at Swensons, loved the scene and the smell and best of all the taste (order it with everything to get the full effect). But it wasn&#x2019;t until much later, when I was blessed with a skill I was able to develop, that I ever got much of a chance to eat one. A burger at Swensons? There was no way I could afford something like that.</p><p>Because Akron, for all its goodness of heart, wasn&#x2019;t soft. There were gangs and there were drugs and there were grim housing projects where sirens and gunfire went off in the night. There was an inner city, maybe not as bad as Cleveland or Chicago or Philadelphia. But it was there, and I know it was there because I spent a lot of my childhood living within it, hearing those sounds and just trying to keep going, just keep my head low and keep on moving. And maybe if there was anything that was really different about me from other kids growing up in similar circumstances, it was that idea: </p><p>Just keep on moving.</p><p>Growing up in the inner city is not the hardest thing in the world to do. What my mom Gloria went through&#x2014;having me by herself when she was sixteen years old and trying to raise me and give me everything I wanted&#x2014;was so much harder. But certainly it&#x2019;s also not the easiest place in the world to begin your life, particularly when you see so many people who never even get to the middle.</p><p>You definitely have no choice but to see and hear things you never want to experience and you never ever want your kids to experience&#x2014;violence and drug abuse and the mournful music of those police sirens wailing. You lie in bed, and you just know something bad is happening, something heavy, and you just thank the Lord that it isn&#x2019;t you out there in it, and you lie in bed some more and just wait for those sounds to go away. Eventually they do. But it&#x2019;s hard to fall back asleep after that. Sometimes it&#x2019;s impossible. Was there just a terrible fight? Are the police busting for drugs again? What was that noise? No matter how much I tried to shut everything out, and I have always been good at shutting everything out, they have an impact. But maybe not the way you might be thinking.</p><p>Because it helps you grow up when you are an only child. It helps you to learn to take care of yourself. It also helps to motivate you&#x2014;if you ever are lucky enough to find a way out of where you are, even if it&#x2019;s for a few hours, you are going to run with it as fast as you can.</p><p>Whatever I went through, I always loved Akron. And even back then, growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, there was one thing that always bothered me. In school, whenever I looked at a map of the United States&#x2014;because you know how schools are, there is always a map of the United States in every classroom&#x2014;the first thing I did was look at Ohio. There was Cleveland, of course, because everybody knew Cleveland, former home of the legendary Browns and Jimmy Brown, home of the Indians. On some maps there might be the state capital of Columbus. Or even Cincinnati. But where was Akron? How come there was never Akron?</p><p>Akron who? Akron where?</p><p>Akron nobody, as far as the mapmakers were concerned. That always got to me. Why wasn&#x2019;t my hometown there? I don&#x2019;t remember how old I was exactly, maybe eight or nine. But I promised myself, in the funny way that little kids make promises over things that nobody else in the world cares about, that one day I was going to put Akron on the map. Maybe not literally, because you could tell those mapmakers were a prickly bunch, but I was going to let the world know where Akron was. I didn&#x2019;t know how. I just knew in my heart I was going to do it.</p><p>Was I a dreamer?</p><p>Of course I was.</p><p>But if you wish hard enough, try hard enough, find the right group of guys to dream along with you, then maybe, because there is always a maybe with dreams, they can come true.</p></p><h2>Rich Christians In An Age Of Hunger: Moving from Affluence to Generosity (20th Anniversary Revision)</h2><p><p>In the 20th anniversary revision of his groundbreaking book <i>Rich Christians In An Age of Hunger</i>, Ronald Sider examines the complex causes of poverty and offers concrete, practical proposals for social and individual change. The most thorough, biblical case against poverty-20 years ago or today.</p></p><p>Ronald J. Sider, Ph.D., is a professor of theology at Eastern Seminary. He serves as president of Evangelicals for Social Action, and has published more than twenty books.Rich Christians In An Age Of Hunger is written for our times, when every day more than 34,000 children die of starvation and preventable diseases, and 1. 3 billion human beings live in relentless, unrelieved poverty worldwide. Why is there still so much poverty in the world? Conservatives blame sinful individual choices and laziness. Liberals condemn economic and social structures. Who is right? Who is wrong? Both, according to Ronald Sider in this newly revised, expanded and updated edition of Rich Christians In An Age Of Hunger. Sider explains that poverty is the result of complex causes, and then he presents practical, workable proposes for change, proposals that should be taken up by every man and every woman who seeks to deserve the title "Christian" and to apply and to follow the teaches of Jesus of Nazareth in the modern world. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p>
